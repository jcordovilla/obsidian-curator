# Scripts Directory

This directory contains the main execution scripts for the Obsidian Note Curator system.

## üöÄ Main Scripts

### `process_vault.py`
Process your entire Obsidian vault for classification and curation.

```bash
poetry run python scripts/process_vault.py
```

### `test_classification_system.py`
Test the classification system with a small sample of notes to validate performance.

```bash
poetry run python scripts/test_classification_system.py
```

### `analyze_test_results.py`
Simple analysis script that studies test outputs and draws conclusions.

```bash
poetry run python scripts/analyze_test_results.py
```

This script:
- Automatically finds the latest test results
- Analyzes classification performance
- Examines content relevance
- Identifies potential issues
- Draws conclusions and provides recommendations
- No interactive prompts - just runs and shows results

## üë§ Human Validation

### `human_validation_classification.py`
Interactive interface for human validation of AI classification results.

```bash
python3 scripts/human_validation_classification.py
```

**Features:**
- Review AI classification decisions
- Provide human judgments and reasoning
- Track agreement rates between human and AI
- Generate improvement recommendations
- Export validation results for analysis

### `test_human_validation.py`
Test script for validation logic using sample data.

```bash
python3 scripts/test_human_validation.py
```

### `run_validation_demo.py`
Demonstration of validation interface capabilities.

```bash
python3 scripts/run_validation_demo.py
```

## üìä Workflow

1. **Test the system**: `test_classification_system.py`
2. **Analyze results**: `analyze_test_results.py`
3. **Validate with humans**: `human_validation_classification.py`
4. **Process full vault**: `process_vault.py` (when ready)

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

The system is optimized for:
- ‚úÖ **CPU-only processing** for stability and compatibility
- ‚úÖ **Optimized context windows** for better model utilization
- ‚úÖ **Efficient thread allocation** for macOS performance
- ‚úÖ **Caching and parallel processing** for improved speed

## üìÅ Output

Results are saved to:
- `results/test_runs/` - Test results and detailed analysis
- `results/full_runs/` - Full vault processing results
- `results/human_validation/` - Human validation sessions and analysis
- `results/normalized_notes/` - Processed and normalized notes

## üîß Script Maintenance

This directory has been cleaned up to remove legacy and experimental scripts. The current scripts represent the stable, production-ready functionality:

- **Core Processing**: `process_vault.py`, `test_classification_system.py`
- **Analysis**: `analyze_test_results.py`
- **Human Validation**: `human_validation_classification.py` and related utilities
- **Testing**: Validation logic tests and demos

All scripts are actively maintained and tested for compatibility with the current system version.
