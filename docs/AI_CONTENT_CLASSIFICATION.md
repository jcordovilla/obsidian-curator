# AI Content Classification System

## Overview

The AI Content Classification System is a revolutionary enhancement to Obsidian Curator that uses artificial intelligence to intelligently analyze and process different types of note content. Instead of applying one-size-fits-all cleaning rules, the system now:

1. **Classifies content** into specific categories using AI
2. **Selects appropriate processing strategies** for each content type
3. **Applies specialized cleaning** based on content characteristics
4. **Validates quality** using category-specific criteria
5. **Provides detailed metadata** about processing decisions

## How It Works

### 1. Content Analysis Phase

When a note is processed, the AI classifier analyzes the raw content and determines:

- **Content Category**: URL bookmark, web clipping, PDF annotation, etc.
- **Confidence Level**: How certain the AI is about the classification
- **Processing Strategy**: Which specialized processor to use
- **Quality Indicators**: Content characteristics that affect processing

### 2. Specialized Processing Phase

Based on the AI classification, content is processed using specialized strategies:

- **URL Bookmarks**: Extract title and URL, minimal cleaning
- **Web Clippings**: Aggressive HTML cleaning with navigation removal
- **PDF Annotations**: Preserve both PDF content and user notes
- **Pure Text Notes**: Minimal cleaning to preserve structure
- **Social Media Posts**: Remove platform chrome, extract post content
- **Academic Papers**: Preserve academic structure, clean formatting
- **Corporate Content**: Extract business content, remove marketing
- **News Articles**: Extract article content, remove navigation
- **Technical Documents**: Preserve technical structure, clean formatting

### 3. Quality Validation Phase

After processing, content is validated using category-specific quality criteria:

- **Length requirements** appropriate for the content type
- **Content structure** validation
- **Navigation artifact** detection
- **Meaningful content** assessment

## Content Categories

### URL Bookmark
- **Characteristics**: Just title + URL, minimal description
- **Processing**: Extract title and URL, minimal cleaning
- **Quality Check**: Must have clear title and URL, not too verbose

### Web Clipping
- **Characteristics**: Full webpage content with navigation/chrome
- **Processing**: Aggressive HTML cleaning, navigation removal
- **Quality Check**: Substantial content (>100 words), minimal navigation artifacts

### PDF Annotation
- **Characteristics**: PDF content + user notes/annotations
- **Processing**: Separate PDF content from user notes, preserve both
- **Quality Check**: Must have both PDF reference and user annotations

### Image Annotation
- **Characteristics**: Image + explanatory text
- **Processing**: Extract image references and explanatory text
- **Quality Check**: Image references present, substantial explanatory text

### Audio/Video Note
- **Characteristics**: Media file + transcript/notes
- **Processing**: Extract media references and notes
- **Quality Check**: Media references present, substantial notes

### Pure Text Note
- **Characteristics**: Original writing, no external content
- **Processing**: Minimal cleaning, preserve structure
- **Quality Check**: Substantial content (>300 chars), not repetitive

### Mixed Content
- **Characteristics**: Combination of multiple types
- **Processing**: Identify sections, process each with appropriate strategy
- **Quality Check**: Each section meets quality standards

### Social Media Post
- **Characteristics**: Social media content
- **Processing**: Remove platform chrome, extract post content
- **Quality Check**: Substantial post content (>100 chars)

### Academic Paper
- **Characteristics**: Research papers, academic content
- **Processing**: Preserve academic structure, clean formatting
- **Quality Check**: Substantial content (>200 chars), academic structure

### Corporate Content
- **Characteristics**: Business reports, corporate info
- **Processing**: Extract business content, remove marketing
- **Quality Check**: Substantial business content (>150 chars)

### News Article
- **Characteristics**: News content
- **Processing**: Extract article content, remove navigation
- **Quality Check**: Substantial article content (>200 chars)

### Technical Document
- **Characteristics**: Technical specs, manuals
- **Processing**: Preserve technical structure, clean formatting
- **Quality Check**: Substantial technical content (>150 chars)

## Configuration

### Enable AI Classification

In your `config.yaml`:

```yaml
# AI Model Configuration
ai_model: "gpt-oss:20b"
enable_ai_classification: true  # Enable AI-powered content classification
ai_classification_model: "phi3:mini"  # Model for content type classification
```

### Processing Options

The system automatically configures processing based on content type:

```yaml
# Content processing is automatically configured based on AI classification
# No manual configuration needed for individual content types
```

## Benefits

### 1. **Intelligent Content Understanding**
- AI understands content context and purpose
- No more misclassification of content types
- Appropriate processing for each content category

### 2. **Better Content Quality**
- Specialized cleaning strategies for each type
- Preservation of important content structure
- Removal of relevant clutter only

### 3. **Improved Metadata**
- Rich AI analysis metadata for each note
- Processing strategy documentation
- Quality scores and validation results

### 4. **Adaptive Processing**
- System learns from your content patterns
- Handles new content types automatically
- Fallback to rule-based classification if AI fails

### 5. **Professional Results**
- Content appropriate for professional use
- Consistent quality across different content types
- Better theme classification and organization

## Example Output

### AI Analysis Metadata

Each processed note includes detailed AI analysis:

```yaml
ai_analysis:
  category: "web_clipping"
  confidence: 0.92
  processing_strategy: "aggressive_web_cleaning_with_ai_validation"
  quality_score: 0.85
  processing_notes:
    - "Processing as web clipping with aggressive cleaning"
    - "Successfully cleaned web content"
```

### Processing Results

Content is processed according to its type:

- **URL Bookmarks**: Clean title + URL structure
- **Web Clippings**: Article content without navigation
- **PDF Annotations**: Separated PDF and user content
- **Pure Text Notes**: Preserved original structure

## Performance Considerations

### AI Model Selection

- **phi3:mini**: Fast classification, good accuracy (recommended)
- **llama3.1:8b**: Better accuracy, moderate speed
- **gpt-oss:20b**: Best accuracy, slower processing

### Fallback Strategy

If AI classification fails:
1. System falls back to rule-based classification
2. Processing continues with traditional methods
3. No interruption to curation workflow

### Caching

- Classification results are cached during processing
- Repeated analysis of similar content is optimized
- Overall performance impact is minimal

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **AI Classification Fails**
   - Check Ollama installation and model availability
   - Verify network connectivity for model downloads
   - System automatically falls back to rule-based classification

2. **Unexpected Content Types**
   - Review AI confidence scores
   - Check processing notes for insights
   - Adjust classification patterns if needed

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Use faster models (phi3:mini) for classification
   - Disable AI classification if needed
   - Monitor processing times and adjust accordingly

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging to troubleshoot issues:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

1. **Learning from User Feedback**
   - Improve classification based on curation decisions
   - Adaptive processing strategies
   - Personalized content handling

2. **Advanced Content Analysis**
   - Sentiment analysis for content tone
   - Topic modeling for better organization
   - Content complexity assessment

3. **Integration with External Services**
   - Enhanced PDF processing
