poetry run obsidian-curator curate /Users/jose/Documents/Obsidian/Evermd curated-vault

# Monitor progress and results
tail -f curated-vault/metadata/curation-log.md
```

## Configuration

### **Optimized Default Configuration** ðŸŽ¯

The system now uses **optimized thresholds** for better content capture. Create a `config.yaml` file:

```yaml
# AI Configuration - Multi-Model Architecture
ai_model: "gpt-oss:20b"  # Primary model for complex reasoning
max_tokens: 2000

# Quality Thresholds - Optimized for Better Content Capture
quality_threshold: 0.65  # Lowered from 0.75 for broader capture
relevance_threshold: 0.65 # Maintained for precision
analytical_depth_threshold: 0.65  # For publication-ready content
professional_writing_threshold: 0.65  # Lowered from 0.70 for analytical content
min_content_length: 300   # Reduced from 500 for valuable short notes

# Target Themes
target_themes:
  - infrastructure
  - construction
  - governance

# Processing Options
preserve_metadata: true
clean_html: true
```

### **Performance-Optimized Configuration**

For **maximum content capture** with maintained quality:

```yaml
# Optimized for broader content inclusion
quality_threshold: 0.65
professional_writing_threshold: 0.65
min_content_length: 300
relevance_threshold: 0.65
```

For **high-quality curation** (more selective):

```yaml
# More selective curation
quality_threshold: 0.75
professional_writing_threshold: 0.70
min_content_length: 500
relevance_threshold: 0.70
```

For **balanced approach**:

```yaml
# Balanced curation
quality_threshold: 0.70
professional_writing_threshold: 0.68
min_content_length: 400
relevance_threshold: 0.68
```

## Multi-Model AI Architecture

### **Model Specialization**

The system now uses **multiple AI models** for specialized tasks:

- **`phi3:mini`**: Efficient content curation and initial screening
- **`llama3.1:8b`**: Detailed quality analysis and assessment
- **`gpt-oss:20b`**: Complex reasoning and theme classification

### **Performance Benefits**

- **Efficient Processing**: Smaller models for simple tasks, larger for complex ones
- **Specialized Analysis**: Each model optimized for specific functions
- **Fallback Handling**: Graceful degradation when models are unavailable
- **Resource Optimization**: Better memory and processing efficiency

## Advanced Configuration

### **Enhanced Processing Options**

```yaml
# Advanced Processing Configuration
processing:
  batch_size: 10                    # Notes processed per batch
  max_concurrent_ai: 3             # Maximum concurrent AI analysis
  preserve_metadata: true           # Keep original note metadata
  clean_html: true                  # Remove web clutter
  enhanced_content_processing: true # Advanced content type handling

# Performance Monitoring
performance:
  enable_metrics: true              # Track processing performance
  log_timing: true                  # Detailed timing analysis
  throughput_analysis: true         # Notes processed per minute
```

### **Theme Customization**

```yaml
# Custom Theme Hierarchy
custom_themes:
  infrastructure:
    - ppps: "Public-Private Partnerships"
    - resilience: "Climate Adaptation & Disaster Recovery"
    - financing: "Funding & Investment Analysis"
    - governance: "Regulation & Policy"
    - technology: "Innovation & Digital Transformation"

max_concurrent_ai: 5
quality_threshold: 0.65  # Broader capture
min_content_length: 300  # Include short notes
```

#### **High-Quality Curation**
```yaml
# Focus on quality over quantity
quality_threshold: 0.75
professional_writing_threshold: 0.70
min_content_length: 500
batch_size: 5  # Smaller batches for detailed analysis
```

#### **Testing and Development**
```yaml

cat curated-vault/metadata/performance-metrics.md
```

## Troubleshooting

### **Common Setup Issues**

#### **1. PyYAML Dependency Error**
```bash
# If you get "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'yaml'"
poetry add pyyaml
poetry install
```

#### **2. Ollama Connection Issues**
```bash
# Check if Ollama is running
ollama serve

# Verify models are available
ollama list

# Test model response
ollama run phi3:mini "Hello, world!"
```

#### **3. Configuration Validation**
```bash
# Validate your configuration
poetry run obsidian-curator validate-config

# Check configuration syntax
poetry run obsidian-curator curate --dry-run /path/to/input /path/to/output
```

### **Performance Issues**

#### **Low Curation Rate**
- **Use optimized thresholds**: quality: 0.65, professional writing: 0.65
- Check theme alignment with your content
- Verify AI model performance and availability

#### **Slow Processing**
- Monitor multi-model usage and resource allocation
- Check batch processing configuration
- Verify Ollama service status

#### **Memory Issues**
