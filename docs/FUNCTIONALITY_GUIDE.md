# Obsidian Curator - Complete Functionality Guide

## Overview

Obsidian Curator is an AI-powered system that transforms raw Obsidian vaults into curated, organized knowledge bases. It uses **multi-model local AI models via Ollama** to intelligently analyze, clean, categorize, and organize notes based on quality, relevance, and thematic content. **Now with enhanced performance and optimized curation thresholds for better content capture.**

## Core Architecture

The system consists of five main components that work together to process and curate content:

### 1. Content Processor (`content_processor.py`)
**Purpose**: Handles the initial processing and cleaning of raw notes from the Obsidian vault.

**Key Functions**:
- **Note Discovery**: Scans the input vault directory for markdown files (`.md` extension)
- **Metadata Extraction**: Parses YAML frontmatter from notes to extract:
  - Title, tags, source URLs, creation/modification dates
  - Custom metadata fields preserved for context
- **Content Type Detection**: Automatically identifies note types:
  - `WEB_CLIPPING`: Full articles scraped from websites with substantial HTML content
  - `URL_REFERENCE`: Simple bookmarks or URL references with minimal content  
  - `PERSONAL_NOTE`: User-created notes and drafts
  - `ACADEMIC_PAPER`: Research papers, journal articles, academic content
  - `PDF_ANNOTATION`: Notes containing PDF references or annotations
  - `IMAGE_ANNOTATION`: Notes with embedded images or image references
  - `PROFESSIONAL_PUBLICATION`: Industry publications, LinkedIn articles
- **HTML Cleaning**: Removes web clutter, ads, navigation elements, and formatting artifacts
- **Content Normalization**: Converts HTML to clean markdown, preserves structure
- **Enhanced Processing**: Better handling of mixed content types and complex structures

**Input**: Raw markdown files from Obsidian vault
**Output**: `Note` objects with cleaned content and metadata
