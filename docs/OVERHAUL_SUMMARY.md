# Obsidian Note Curator - Overhaul Summary

## What Was Overhauled

The original `filter_notes.py` script has been completely transformed into a professional, enterprise-grade note classification system. Here's what changed:

### Before (Old System)
- Single Python script with hardcoded configuration
- Basic binary classification (useful/not useful)
- Limited to infrastructure topics
- No structured output or reporting
- Manual configuration changes required
- No error handling or progress tracking

### After (New System)
- **Poetry-based package** with proper dependency management
- **Domain-aware classification** based on your expert pillars
- **Multi-stage processing** with different LLM models for different tasks
- **Rich configuration** via YAML files
- **Professional CLI interface** with progress tracking
- **Comprehensive reporting** in multiple formats
- **Extensible architecture** for future enhancements

## Key Improvements

### 1. Expert Domain Alignment
The new system is specifically designed around your five expert pillars:

- **PPP Fundamentals** - Public-private partnerships, project finance, governance
- **Operational Risk** - Risk management in complex infrastructure projects  
- **Value for Money** - Lifecycle value, resilience, and long-term outcomes
- **Digital Transformation** - BIM, data analytics, automation
- **Governance & Transparency** - Stakeholder alignment, open data

### 2. Sophisticated Classification
Instead of simple binary classification, the new system provides:

- **Multi-dimensional scoring** (relevance, depth, actionability, uniqueness, structure)
- **Note type classification** (literature, workflows, reflections, technical, meetings, community)
- **Pillar-specific analysis** with confidence scores and keyword detection
- **Four-tier curation actions** (keep, refine, archive, delete)

### 3. Professional Architecture
- **Modular design** with separate components for different tasks
- **Configuration-driven** behavior via YAML files
- **Error handling** and graceful degradation
- **Progress tracking** with rich console output
- **Batch processing** for large vaults
- **Extensible data models** using Pydantic

### 4. Rich Output and Reporting
- **JSON results** for programmatic access
- **Markdown reports** for human reading
- **Curation action files** with detailed recommendations
- **Summary statistics** and quality distributions
- **Timestamps and metadata** for tracking

## Usage Comparison

### Old Way
```bash
# Edit hardcoded values in filter_notes.py
# Run script
python filter_notes.py
# Check single JSON output file
```

### New Way
```bash
# Install with Poetry
poetry install

# Check system status
poetry run curate-notes status

# Analyze sample notes
poetry run curate-notes analyze --sample-size 10

# Analyze single note
poetry run curate-notes analyze-single --file note.md

# Get detailed reports
ls results/
```

## Configuration Flexibility

### Vault Settings

## Output Quality

### Before
- Simple JSON with basic classification
- No reasoning or confidence scores
- Limited metadata

### After
- **Rich analysis data** with quality scores
- **Detailed reasoning** for each decision
- **Pillar-specific insights** with keyword detection
- **Multiple output formats** for different use cases
- **Comprehensive metadata** and timestamps

## Performance Improvements
