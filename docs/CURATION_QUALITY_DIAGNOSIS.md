## ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL GAPS FOR PROFESSIONAL WRITING**

### **1. Critical Analysis Depth Assessment**
**Current Capability**: Basic quality scoring (0-1 scale)
**Missing**: Evaluation of argument sophistication, evidence quality, critical thinking patterns

**Required Enhancements**:
```python
# Add to QualityScore model:
analytical_depth: float      # 0-1 scale for argument sophistication
evidence_quality: float      # 0-1 scale for data/reference quality
critical_thinking: float     # 0-1 scale for challenging assumptions
argument_structure: float    # 0-1 scale for logical flow
```

### **2. Professional Insight Recognition**
**Current Capability**: Generic infrastructure relevance
**Missing**: Recognition of industry expertise, strategic thinking, business acumen

**Required Enhancements**:
```python
# Enhanced theme analysis:
expertise_level: str         # "entry", "intermediate", "expert", "thought_leader"
content_category: str        # "strategic", "tactical", "policy", "technical"
business_value: str          # "operational", "strategic", "governance"
```

### **3. Content Structure Analysis**
**Current Capability**: Basic completeness scoring
**Missing**: Analysis of logical flow, argument structure, conclusion quality

**Required Enhancements**:
```python
# Content structure assessment:
has_clear_problem: bool
has_evidence: bool
has_multiple_perspectives: bool
has_actionable_conclusions: bool
logical_flow_score: float
```

### **4. Evidence Quality Assessment**
**Current Capability**: Basic credibility scoring
**Missing**: Citation recognition, data source evaluation, reference completeness

**Required Enhancements**:
```python
# Evidence quality metrics:
citation_count: int
data_source_credibility: float
reference_completeness: float
evidence_relevance: float
```
