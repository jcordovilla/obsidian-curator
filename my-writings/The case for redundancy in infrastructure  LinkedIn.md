> [!abstract] The case for redundancy in infrastructure

Raising funds for large-scale infrastructure investments is quite a task. Even if the socioeconomic cost-benefit analysis confirms the advantage of a particular investment, even with the social and environmental safeguards fully vetted and the benefit of public opinion for it, there is still the long struggle of securing the big amount, in competition with a myriad other public projects, goods and services to meet the growing demand of the population.

Now, imagine having to raise funds for an infrastructure that somehow duplicates the function of an existing one, in fact becoming a redundant infrastructure. Why would you want to do that? The numbers certainly won't add up in the models. Resources are already scarce enough, and excess capacity goes against principles of efficiency and sustainability.

Now, let me question that view and the tyranny of economic models in decision-making, for a moment. Let me make something very clear: I am not for resource wasting, nor for reckless growth or irrational exuberance, and certainly not for "building stuff" just for the sake of maintaining jobs and firms in an industry with a standing tradition of inefficiency and lack of transparency. As a Spaniard I am well used to the cases of empty regional airports and underutilised high-speed rail lines that feed many of our political chats at home.

I am, however, **for questioning the conventional way of doings things**, especially when it comes to an issue as strategic as national infrastructure planning.

I may not get it completely right, but critical thinking is imperative when it comes to great challenges, so, for the sake of questioning, I will visit the case for redundant infrastructure.

### Beyond the numbers

National infrastructure is a complex, multifaceted challenge that transcends the economic models and financial metrics. It's a commitment that shapes the future of a nation, deeply rooted in a web of social, environmental, and geopolitical considerations.

Take, for instance, the transformative power of public transportation. More than just a means to get from one place to another, a well-designed transit system will serve as a catalyst for social cohesion. As new subway lines and bus routes weave through previously isolated neighborhoods, they do more than facilitate movement; they connect communities and foster a sense of shared destiny. Over time, these physical connections **can translate into a profound sense of social unity, breaking down barriers and creating a more inclusive society**. The success of such an endeavor isn't just measured in passenger numbers or revenue, but in the less tangible yet equally important metrics of public trust and community engagement.

### Redundancy = Bad ?

Infrastructure redundancy is a compelling topic, especially when viewed through the lens of economic resilience. Redundancy, often seen as an excess or duplication, can actually serve as a vital component in ensuring the robustness and resilience of a system.

> The notion of infrastructure as a strategic asset extends to the realm of national security.

Ports, highways, and energy grids are not merely conduits for trade and commerce; they are critical components of a nation's defense infrastructure. Their resilience against natural disasters, cyber-attacks, and other malicious or unintended shocks is paramount for maintaining national stability. The measures that incrase the robustness of these infrastructures against shocks becomes the yardstick by which we measure not just their utility, but their contribution to the nation's overall security posture. Redundancy is one important measure of this kind.

### Sustainability is also about Resilience

As we grapple with climate change, the environmental sustainability of our infrastructure projects takes on central importance. The decisions we make today—whether investing in renewable energy, implementing waste management systems, or designing eco-friendly urban spaces—will have a lasting impact on our planet's health. The metrics are shifting from short-term profitability to long-term sustainability, measured in carbon footprints reduced, waste efficiently managed, and renewable energy sources tapped.

On the other hand, the strategic importance of infrastructure isn't confined within a nation's borders; it extends to the geopolitical stage.

> Resilient infrastructure networks can significantly enhance a country's influence, facilitating trade and fostering diplomatic ties.

These networks become conduits for both economic and diplomatic relationships, serving as physical manifestations of strategic alliances and partnerships.

In the end, the ultimate goal of any infrastructure investment should be to elevate the quality of life for current and future generations. Therefore, the decisions to invest in large infrastructure projects are strategic movements that involve holistic consideration of various factors, each contributing to the overarching narrative of a nation's development. It is a story not just told in numbers and spreadsheets, but in the experiences lived by its people, the resilience of its communities and institutions, and the standing of their country on the global stage.

Now let us move from the ideallistic vision to the more practical exercise of some pros and cons of redundancy.

### Pros of Redundancy in Infrastructure

1. **Resilience**: Redundant systems are generally more resilient to shocks. In the context of trasnport infrastructure, for instance, having redundant networks means that if one route is compromised—due to natural disasters, accidents, or maintenance—the other can serve as an alternative. This is particularly important for emergency services and critical supply chains.

2. **Flexibility and Choice**: Redundancy provides options for different types of users. For instance, those who prioritize speed and are willing to pay may opt for toll roads or express lanes, while others who prefer a more scenic route or have budget constraints can use non-toll alternatives.

3. **Economic Opportunities**: Multiple routes can stimulate economic activity in different areas. Diversification can be beneficial for regional development.

4. **Demand Management**: Having more than one alternative can help distribute demand more evenly, reducing congestion. This is particularly useful during peak travel times or large-scale events.

5. **Future-Proofing**: As populations grow and infrastructure needs evolve, having extra capacity can be an advantage. It provides the system with the ability to adapt to increased demand without requiring immediate, costly upgrades.

### Cons of Redundancy in Infrastructure

1. **Resource Intensive**: Building and maintaining multiple assets require significant investment. This can be seen as a waste of public resources, especially if one of the assets is underutilized.

2. **Environmental Impact**: More infrastruture means more land use and potentially more pollution, both from construction and increased use. This is a critical concern in the context of sustainability and climate change.

3. **Social Equity**: Paid infrastructure (such as toll roads) is often better maintained and less congested but requires payment. This creates a two-tier system where those who can afford it have access to better infrastructure, raising questions of social equity.

4. **Complexity**: Managing multiple, interconnected assets, each with its own set of challenges and requirements, can be administratively and technically complex and costly.

5. **Induced Demand**: Increasing capacity can sometimes lead to increased demand (as in the case or urban roads), negating some of the intended benefits of congestion reduction.

### And so...

Redundancy in infrastructure can be viewed through different lenses, each with its own set of values and priorities. From a systems thinking perspective, redundancy adds resilience and flexibility to the network. It acts as a buffer, allowing the system to absorb shocks and adapt to changing conditions over time. This is particularly relevant in a world facing increasing uncertainty due to factors like climate change and economic volatility.

In the long term, the "extra capacity" in a network may become a strategic asset in itself, but its value will be significantly influenced by how well it is integrated into broader social and economic policies. These should ideally be aligned with sustainability goals and take into account the diverse needs of the population.

Redundancy in infrastructure isn't just about having more; it's about having more options, more resilience, and more opportunities for sustainable development. But these come with their own set of challenges that require thoughtful planning, innovation and governance.
