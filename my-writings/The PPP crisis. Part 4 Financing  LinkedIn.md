### THE FIRST PILLAR OF PPPs: ACCESS TO MORE FINANCING TO MAKE INFRASTRUCTURE POSSIBLE

The main -and most powerful reason- why governments turn their interest to the PPP model is to attract financial resources from the private sector to finance more infrastructure without increasing public debt.

> Most public infrastructure has very high investment costs and low cost-recovery rates -mainly for political reasons, thus frequently requiring tariff subsidies.

The fiscal constraints and the lack of flexible, innovative and socially responsible financial instruments push many governments to the use of highly indebted PPPs through commercial loans, for the financing of infrastructure that is not economically self-sustainable in the short -term. It is not difficult to conclude that this is just a mirage -the mirage of PPPs- once we remember that, in practice, only a minimum part of public infrastructure is financed by this procurement model (see charts in [Part Two](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ppp-crisis-part-two-history-jose-cordovilla/)).

The mirage of PPPs **becomes more vivid to the eyes of regional and local governments**, who are eager to replicate development phenomena that they see happening in large cities and therefore quickly seduced by the appeal of large private investments.

These governments hardly recognise that it is precisely the intrinsic dynamics of large cities that generate the continuous flow of capital that sustain private investment, not the PPP formula itself. Here lies precisely a great risk of resounding PPP failures, which fuel public opposition to this type of collaboration.

Because what happens in reality is: In the absence of steady and proven revenue streams, the private sector will not jump to the arena unless there are mechanisms in place to supplement or replace user payments (investment aid, co-financing, availability payment) or hedging instruments (public guarantees and insurance). Many of these measures, as [Eurostat](https://www.eib.org/attachments/thematic/epec_eurostat_statistical_guide_en.pdf) and the [European Court of Auditors](https://www.eca.europa.eu/es/Pages/DocItem.aspx?did=45153) have concluded, often distort the principle of risk transfer by which the higher cost of (private) debt will be offset by efficiency gains in the provision. The 2017 Spanish law for public procurement already contains detailed provisions (Art.14) about the transfer of operational risk, something that did not exist in the previous version of the law and has been incorporated by mandate of the [European Concession Directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/ES/ALL/?uri=OJ%3AJOL_2014_094_R_0001_01).

An example of questionable diligence in the public management of operational risk can be found in ACESA, the first of Spain's highway concessions, which was granted in 1967 and after fifty-two years endures thanks to successive modifications and extensions of the contract poorly managed by the government counterpart: the last addendum of 2006 resulted in a lawsuit from the concessionaire, who claims up to EUR 3,000 million in compensation.

On the other hand, the most expensive elements of infrastructure projects often have very long lifespans, some reaching over 50 years (for instance, large structures or road embankments). The accounting of these assets is done in practice using accelerated depreciation rates, resulting in much shorter depreciation periods than the actual physical deterioration, and allowing for a reduction of the corporate tax base. We should remember that the vehicle companies are often articulated through complex corporate arrangements and capital flows through subsidiaries in tax havens. These large financial operations are therefore susceptible to contributing to tax base erosion and profit shifting, a process that significantly weakens the ability to achieve a fundamental objective of PPPs: the creation of public value.

A notable case of this phenomenon is Thames Water, the private company that manages water supply and sewerage in London. This company has been involved in huge controversies for having distributed [large dividends to its successive shareholders while the quality of service decreased](https://www.ft.com/content/5413ebf8-24f1-11e7-8691-d5f7e0cd0a16) and [debt increased dramatically](https://www.ft.com/content/61bd8f0a-9181-11e7-bdfa-eda243196c2c), despite the sophisticated control mechanisms put in place by the public regulator. The United Kingdom privatised the companies providing water supply and sewerage services in the 1980s, along with the creation of an independent regulator, OFWAT, who sets the targets for service performance, the tariff rate structures, investment requirements and profitability caps for these operators.

This case is not alone in the long history of private participation in water in the UK: a [comprehensive study by the University of Greenwich](https://gala.gre.ac.uk/id/eprint/21097/) concluded in 2018 that increases in household water bills (40% since the privatisation in 1989) have ended up covering the growing interests of the debt, despite the fact that tariff increases were designed to offset cost escalation and to cover investments for the extension and improvement of the infrastructure.

The argument of PPPs bringing additional financial resources therefore requires a detailed examination of the legal and financial fundamentals of infrastructure, and especially of how they address the service requirements and the dynamics of interests, capacities and limitations of the parties involved, along with the governance mechanisms that help consolidate long-term objectives. Let us not forget that large public interest projects such as PPPs transcend financial issues, and yet finance currently attracts most the attention. The question of financing for investment should be one of the many elements in the set of factors behind strategic decision making for the territory.
