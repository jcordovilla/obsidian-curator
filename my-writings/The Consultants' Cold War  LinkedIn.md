My job as director of advisory services at [TYPSA](https://www.linkedin.com/company/typsa/) \-a firm largely specialised in design and construction management of big projects- often involves competing with accounting and consulting firms such as the "big four" (EY, Deloitte, PwC, KPMG) or the "MBB" (McKinsey, Bain, Boston Consulting Group). At a very basic, almost reptilian-brain level, clients would often label me as an **engineer**, even though I have worked in the role of consultant most my professional life. On the other hand, clients would call people from those other companies **consultants**, a term that carries a plethora of connotations, both positive and negative.

In my industry (infrastructure), this competition between engineering firms and consulting firms tends to happen in a domain of professional services often referred to as "Advisory", which covers a broad range of activities that guide and support the development, implementation, and management of infrastructure projects, including:

-   Project feasibility and planning
-   Funding and financing
-   Public-private partnerships and other alternative delivery models (alternative to traditional public procurement, that is)
-   Infrastructure regulation and policy
-   Procurement and contract management
-   Project implementation and construction management
-   Asset management and operations
-   Sustainability and climate
-   Stakeholder engagement and community impact
-   Technology, digital transformation and innovation

In this article I want to share my thoughts about a growing phenomenon I observe in the Advisory field, that I like to teasingly call "the Consultant's Cold War", in analogy to the geopolitical tensions that happened in the second half of the 20th century between powers that, without never directly fighting each other, clashed on different fronts and formed alliances to gain global influence.

I argue that there are growing market frictions between consulting firms that are "generalists" such as the big four, and those that are "specialists", such as TYPSA, and that these frictions will continue accelerating as technology fuels the transformation of knowledge work and the businesses that are built around it. General consultants keep growing and diversifying as clients' needs evolve, and they are foraging into technical services that once were reserved to engineering firms. The opposite also happens, i.e. engineering firms providing strategic advisory by leveraging technical knowledge and business acumen, but as I argue below, the upper hand is with the large, generalist firms.

I also believe this phenomenon is happening in other territories of the professional services market (IT, government, education, healthcare, etc.) but I will leave the argument to the people who know about those subjects.

My consulting soul requires me to raise a disclaimer at this point: many of the observations and ideas I share here are perceptions and opinions, thus subjective in nature. I may be wrong, but the debate, and the mere fun of it, are worth the exercise.

## Project or client?

In very broad terms, most of the people that work in a company like TYPSA are engineers or architects, and the services we provide are technical (or "vertical") in nature: calculations, sketches, designs, costing, schedules, etc. Our company is **an engineering consulting firm**, typically organised around specific technical disciplines: civil, mechanical, electrical, environmental, chemical, etc., addressing specific sets of problems and solutions related to engineering projects.

Our business operations are often closely tied to project execution: project management, engineering design, quality control, and field supervision. And, most importantly, **the** **structure is often project-centric**. Teams are formed based on the specific engineering expertise required for a project. This leads to a matrix structure where employees might report to both a project manager and a functional manager.

On the other hand, consulting firms like the big four employ people of different educational backgrounds, predominantly trained in business, finance, economics and law, but also engineers. The services they provide (leaving aside auditing, tax and legal advice) **focus on business management processes**, ("horizontal" in nature) such as operations, human resources, finance, marketing, IT, and so on. This is why they are often called "management consultants".

The business operations of a management consulting firm are more diverse across strategy development, business analysis, market research, change management, and organisational restructuring. They often have a more defined hierarchy, with consultants typically working their way up from junior roles (like analysts) to more senior positions (like partners or directors). And, most importantly, **the structure is often client-centric**, and teams are assembled based on the consulting needs of the client. The focus is more on strategic advice than on hands-on project execution.

## The upper hand

There is a widespread (and sour) perception in my guild that management consulting firms are particularly good at drawing very smart and simple slideshows for which they charge clients dearly, using inputs from hard-working engineers who really know about the subject but get paid peanuts for it.

While I recognise that explaining complex problems in the most simple, intuitive way is an form of art worth remunerating, and that business factors are as important as the technical substance, I also believe engineers know a lot of useful things and generate great value for money.

Yet, the reality is much more complicated than that, at a macro level: It's not just about technical expertise; it's about the entire ecosystem of services, relationships, and brand reputation that firms have built over the years.

> One thing is clear to me, however: today, management consulting firms hold a strong competitive advantage in the infrastructure and construction sector against specialised technical consultants, even though the former lack relevant and specific experience and knowledge in the sector compared to the latter. They have the upper hand. They are the Goliaths. Technical consultants are the Davids.

Why is this, really? The question has puzzled me for a long time. By trying to answer it, I want to turn intuition into a structured explanation that hopefully will help me understand the matter better, and see opportunities and risks more clearly, for my own competitive advantage.

## Goliath's perspective

Management consultants offer a wide array of services that go beyond technical consulting. They can handle everything from financial audits to risk management, business planning, legal advice, digital advice and so on. This "**one-stop-shop**" model is attractive to clients who prefer to have multiple aspects of a project managed under one roof. It simplifies communication, coordination, and billing, making the project management process more streamlined.

These firms also have a **global presence** and can leverage international best practices and resources. They can easily scale up for large projects, pulling in experts from various domains and geographies. This is particularly useful in infrastructure projects that often have international stakeholders and require a diverse skill set.

Furthermore, they have **long-standing relationships** with a wide range of stakeholders, from government bodies to financial institutions. These relationships often translate into a level of trust that can be a decisive factor in awarding contracts. Their reputation, built over decades, acts as a form of social proof, assuring clients of their reliability and expertise, even if it's not inherently specialised. This is why they are sometimes called "professional services networks", a concept that goes far beyond consulting.

While they may lack the deep technical expertise of specialised consultants, **management consultants excel in strategic planning and financial structuring**. In my line of work, for instance, understanding the nuances of public-private partnerships, project finance, and governance can be as critical as the engineering aspects. Their expertise in these areas can often complement the technical aspects, providing a more holistic solution.

These firms also **invest heavily in marketing and thought leadership**. They produce research, whitepapers, and case studies that position them as thought leaders in the industry. This not only **attracts clients but also top talent**, creating a virtuous cycle that further enhances their competitive advantage.

Finally, these firms adapt to market needs nimbly. They **quickly incorporate new technologies** and methodologies into their practice, using data analytics, AI, and other advanced tools to provide insights that may not be readily available to smaller, specialised firms.

In summary, while technical consultants may offer deep, focused expertise, generalist consultants bring a combination of scale, adaptability, and a broad range of services that appeals to large clients with complex needs. This is the value proposition that gives them a competitive edge in the infrastructure and construction sector.

## The Client's perspective

The allure of big management consulting firms such as the big four is undeniable. With their global reach, extensive service offerings, and a brand name that commands respect, these firms are often the go-to choice for owners and managers of large-scale infrastructure projects.

However, I ask the following question: Are clients truly getting value for their money when contracting these generalist firms for specialised infrastructure projects, as opposed to employing specialised technical consultants?

One of the most compelling arguments for choosing a big management consulting firm is the **economies of scale** they offer. Their ability to handle multiple aspects of a project, from financial planning to risk assessment, under one roof is undoubtedly convenient. However, this convenience comes at a cost. These firms often have high overheads, including marketing budgets and administrative expenses, which are inevitably passed on to the client. Moreover, the breadth of services may lead to a "jack of all trades, master of none" scenario, where the quality of specialised tasks may suffer.

Clients should take it seriously to gain skills for conducting basic cost-benefit analyses to determine whether economies of scale genuinely offer value. Breaking down the project into its components and comparing the costs and benefits of specialised vs. generalist services can provide valuable insights.

The brand power of big consultants often leads to a form of market inertia where clients gravitate towards what is familiar and seemingly reliable. This inertia can result in a lack of proper market comparison and an **overreliance on reputation rather than specific expertise**.

To counter this, clients should engage in rigorous market research and consider issuing RFPs (Requests for Proposals) with a balanced set of requirements, thresholds and scoring criteria that allow for and encourage technical consultants to participate and compete fairly. This approach not only broadens the pool of potential service providers but also increases the chances of finding a consultant with specialised skills tailored to the project's needs.

The market dominance of big consulting firms can lead to oligopolistic practices, where the lack of competition allows these firms to dictate terms and inflate prices. This is particularly concerning in sectors requiring specialised knowledge, such infrastructure, where these firms may not have the same level of expertise as specialised firms but can edge them out through aggressive marketing and relationship-building.

Regulatory oversight can play a role in ensuring that contract bidding processes are transparent and competitive. Clients can also adopt alternative forms of delivery that share information and experiences more openly, thereby reducing the information asymmetry that often benefits larger firms.

## David's perspective

Specialised technical consultants are often overshadowed by the marketing prowess and brand recognition of larger, generalist firms like the big four. However, specialised firms have their own unique strengths, particularly in offering deep technical expertise and tailored solutions, especially in the complex field of infrastructure systems. There are specific points of leverage that I believe engineering firms can and should target to gain market power. You may have guessed it: few of them are technical.

Specialised firms should **invest in thought leadership** to expose and showcase their expertise, for instance publishing whitepapers, articles, and case studies specifically targeted to non-technical people, shedding light onto the complexities of specific issues within the infrastructure sector.

Forming alliances with other organisations can provide a platform for specialised firms to showcase their expertise. This could be in the form of joint ventures, project collaborations, or even educational partnerships with academic institutions. These alliances can help in sharing risks, costs, and most importantly, in amplifying each other's strengths.

Networking should be strategic and focused on **building relationships** with key decision-makers in the industry, but **from a broader angle**, breaking the self-imposed boundaries of technical knowledge. This involves organising and participating in industry events, webinars, or forums where decision-makers are present, offering technically robust solutions to complex problems, presented from the perspective of the wider stakeholders. The aim is to move beyond transactional interactions and build relationships that position specialised firm as a go-to experts in the field.

Word of mouth and **client testimonials** remain some of the most effective forms of marketing, yet largely underutilised by engineering consulting firms. They should actively seek testimonials from satisfied clients and use these as a centre part of the marketing strategy, as opposed to the near obsession with the megaproject and its technical features. Detailed case studies that outline the challenges, solutions, outcomes and broader impacts of projects also serve as powerful tools for building credibility.

However, rather than trying to be everything to everyone, **I believe engineering consulting firms should focus on their niche expertise**. I also believe digital transformation plays a crucial role in activating this leverage. In the case of TYPSA, for example, the unique combination of i) deep knowledge of engineering and sustainability principles; ii) infrastructure business expertise; and iii) the skills and experience in developing and implementing specialised asset management systems.

This specialisation should be the cornerstone of all marketing and branding efforts, not only in relation with publicity, social media and marketing materials, but in its core commercial and networking strategy. One effective but perhaps counterintuitive way to do this is to promote managed transparency as common practice in the infrastructure sector, and turn it into a unique selling point (I have written about the paradoxical issue of transparency [in a separate article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/paradox-transparency-jose-cordovilla/?trackingId=nrF7LDjQTEq9AienI4crHA%3D%3D)). Sharing methodologies, technologies used, and even challenges faced in previous projects whilst protecting the interests of the parties will ultimately build trust. It will show potential clients that you're not just a service provider but a partner invested in the project's success and, in the case of engineering problems, it will differentiate the firm in a crowded market and make it attractive to clients looking for specialised knowledge, versus generalist firms.

The key is to leverage specialised expertise as a unique selling point, while also adopting modern, effective methods to increase visibility and build trust. This way, engineering firms can and must position themselves as not just an alternative, but as a go-to solution for clients seeking deep, specialised expertise.

**A fascinating time to be both an engineer and a consultant, for sure.**
