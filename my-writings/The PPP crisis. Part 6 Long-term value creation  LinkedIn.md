### THE THIRD PILLAR OF PPPs: COLLABORATION, KNOWLEDGE SHARING AND LONG-TERM BENEFITS.

The financial and technical arguments for PPPs, described in [Part Four: Financing](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ppp-crisis-part-four-financing-jose-cordovilla/) and [Part Five: Efficency](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ppp-crisis-part-five-efficiency-jose-cordovilla/) of this monographic series, respectively, are the most explicit and powerful in the discourse about the advantages of the model. There is, however, a third argument that often stays in a secondary position in the debate, but nonetheless has a much greater influence in the long-term outcome: the ability of the PPP to generate sustained benefits for all stakeholders. We refer to benefits beyond the financial return for the private partner, the fulfilling of the technical requirements of the public partner or the satisfaction of the user receiving the service.

> The value proposition of a PPP usually includes broader aspirations, such as improving the economy and the quality of life in the area, fostering the competitiveness of the private sector, strengthening the institutional capacity of the public sector, generating and exchanging knowledge and professional skills, and so on.

These broad and substantive results (called “outcomes”, as opposed to the short-term "outputs" such as the provision of the service) only become visible in the long run, and they are built gradually, through complex aggregation and positive reinforcement processes taking place between the components of the infrastructure-environment system. Processes fueled by the availability and use of information, the perceptions and actions of the PPP partners, the trust in the rules and mechanisms of collaboration, the knowledge and skills of decision makers and managers, the satisfaction of the user and the taxpayer, etc.

It is precisely these qualitative, intangible elements that confer the jointly-created PPP the ability to adapt and grow. The opposite is also true: their absence generates dynamics of distrust, opportunism, short-termism, erosion of legitimacy and ultimately the termination of the contract and the end of the collaboration.

The strength of a PPP contract lies in the ability of the parties to sustain the values, capabilities, commitments and joint efforts that have motivated it. This is where governance plays a fundamental role in the viability and sustainability of PPPs.

Governance is the bridge that connects values, intentions, efforts and decisions of all parties with the outputs and outcomes of the venture. The longer the duration of the collaboration, the stronger the governance framework should be. The dysfunctionality of the traditional PPP model is due, above all, to the excessive attention we draw to the sophistication of contracts and procedures, at the expense of overlooking the dynamics that forge trust and collaboration among the stakeholders.

The public partner will tend to focus on justifying the viability of the investment, preparing the optimal procurement mechanism and attracting as much private sector competition as possible. In practice, however, **the sustainability of a PPP ultimately depends on the skills and experience of the public servants** who must understand and manage the complexities and unforeseen events over time. These people make decisions in highly uncertain environments that will actually have consequences on the development patterns of several generations to come. In their hands is the creation of intergenerational value.

In Ireland, for example, after the outbreak of the financial crisis of 2008 and the collapse of the construction industry, there was a massive exodus of professionals from the sector that years later led to a critical deficit of workforce to implement a new infrastructure PPP program. The government faced a shortage of professional skills with the corresponding cost inflation for human resources. In Eastern European countries, attempts have been made to develop large PPP programs in infrastructure in the last ten years, but most governments have been failed to manage the programs, finally resorting to conventional public procurement formulas.

PPPs are complex ventures that require a high degree of training and specialisation by all partners involved. The retention of talent capable of managing these ventures is an essential ingredient for long-term success. Instead of focusing solely on building the enormous formal structures required in a PPP, the public partner should first design and implement a strategic program for human and material resources to underpin the infrastructure plan and support the recruitment, training and retention of skilled and committed professionals. A capable public sector is a necessary condition for a successful PPP.

_Figure above: Factors that erode the goal of long-term benefit creation_

Other, much more subtle and powerful causes of the scouring of the foundations of a PPP relate to communication and language. **The opaque and technocratic terminology of PPPs is, in itself, an obstacle to collaboration**. PPPs that use clear, simple and direct language to communicate the intentions, objectives, responsibilities and rights of the parties - including users, taxpayers and other interest groups- are few and far between. The technical, financial and legal jargon that accompanies PPPs creates barriers to the understanding and decision-making capacity of many participants in the joint venture. This is the seed of distrust towards PPPs and the potential loss of legitimacy of the institutions that promote it.

> Collaboration in a diverse and complex environment needs common languages.

I do not argue that technical, financial or legal documents do not require specific languages, but that an extraordinarily important requirement is the existence of a common, clear language to provide sense, alignment and trust between all parties, including of course the general public. It is certainly a task that needs vast collective efforts, but equally necessary. Moreover, if the right incentives are in place, it is an attainable goal. We have -again- real examples in the software sector, which thrives on collaborative ecosystems that use “high-level” languages (much simpler and less technical than their predecessors), open source applications and transparent yet robust exchange protocols.

**Transparency is another** _**sine qua non**_ **requirement for successful infrastructure PPPs.** Take [the case of the "radiales" roads in Spain,](https://elpais.com/elpais/2016/12/12/inenglish/1481549182_337869.html) for example. The Spanish public opinion is that these PPP projects "privatize profits and socialize losses", referring to the "rescue" of the concessionary companies by the Ministry of Public Works. At the core of this rescue is the _Responsabilidad Patrimonial de la Administracion_, or RPA, a legal obligation for the government to compensate companies for past investments less amortization following project default and takeover. The companies involved in this case claim that land acquisition costs were much higher and revenues much lower than foreseen. However, there is little talk on the streets about the financing banks, which have lost up to 70% of the loans they made to the companies to build the roads. And much less is known about the successive decisions made by the government from inception of the projects until their default, and the subsequent rescue and possible liabilities.

Now, my point about transparency: To date, there is ZERO public information on the [website of the Ministry](https://www.fomento.gob.es/) if one wishes to understand why it was decided at the time that those projects were needed and feasible, what led to the default, what the consequences were, what are the liabilities (current and future) of each party (including the taxpayer), or what measures are currently in place to protect the public interest, avoid further damage to collaborations with the private sector and incorporate the lessons learned in future ventures.

The lack of clarity and transparency is pure fuel for widespread distrust about infrastructure PPPs in Spain, which have seen some bad times in the history of infrastructure in the country, but have also generated many sucessful stories, although less likely to appear in press headlines.

An example of the benefits of transparency in infrastructure is in Transport for London (TfL), the London municipal company in charge of urban transport, which in 2016 decided to make all the service information available to the public online, in real time, whilst guaranteeing the anonymity and security of the users. This initiative has triggered a multitude of software applications developed by private companies, NGOs and individuals that offer services and solutions -for profit, leisure or social purposes- that are valuable value to users and society in general.

**Tightly coupled with transparency is the issue of conflicts of interest.** In increasingly complex environments the cause-effect relationship tends to blur and it becomes more difficult to identify the flows of interests. In order for collaborations to last, they need to i) be structured in a coherent way for their purpose; and ii) provide mechanisms that allow adaptation to change. Long-term benefits will materialise if both tasks rely on:

-   Transparency about needs, advantages, weaknesses and interests of the parties when defining the collaboration structure, as well as its operation.
-   Capacity and rigour in the collection and treatment of all relevant information for decision-making, communication and dissemination, as a safeguard against opportunistic behaviours that might damage the principles of partnership.
-   Flexibility, which implies boldness to take some risks and enable environments where innovative formulas can be tested, in a way that the downsides -in case of failure- can be reasonably assumed and the upsides -if succesful- are shared.
