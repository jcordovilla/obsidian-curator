Today I was reading [a post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7110910583469666304?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7110910583469666304%29) by my colleague [Juan Carlos Bravo Recio](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juan-carlos-bravo-recio-5a406110/), whom I regularly follow. It was about the annual report published by Spain's Independent Office for Regulation and Supervision of Public Procurement ([Oirescon](https://www.hacienda.gob.es/es-ES/Oirescon/Paginas/ias.aspx)) and the striking facts and figures about direct contracting of engineering services to State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs).

The report findings, very usefully summarised in [an article published by business newspaper Cinco Días](https://cincodias.elpais.com/companias/2023-09-22/tragsa-e-ineco-al-frente-del-boom-del-contrato-directo-de-la-administracion.html), show that the volume of direct contracts (without competition) awarded to SOEs like INECO and TRAGSA has increased significantly from the previous year. This surge in direct contracting has been met with strong criticism from private engineering firms, such as my employer, who argue that **a large portion of this work should be open to competitive bidding**.

**Of course it should,** unless rigorously and transparently justified otherwise, be open to competitive bidding, always. This if for the benefit of 1) our citizens, ultimate recipients of the services we provide as engineering professionals; 2) our current and future professional talent; 3) our businesses and economy. I would like to share some initial thoughts on why I think so. For the debate.

### A competent but uncompetitive sector

Spain's civil engineering sector is a mature market with a wide range of private [[CONSULTING FIRMS|consulting firms]]. These firms vary in size and have been instrumental in the country's infrastructure development and our international competitve strengths today in the sector.

In Spain, SOEs such as INECO and TRAGSA have historically been large recipients of public contracts without undergoing a competitive bidding process, but the latest trend is taking us into worrying territory. In 2022, SOEs received contracts worth €2.631 billion, marking a 62% increase compared to 2021. The number of contracts directly awarded also rose from 1,888 in 2021 to 2,773 in 2022. ^spain-soes-spending

The government's rationale for this approach includes the speed of project execution and the ability to maintain tighter control over the service provider. On the other hand, however, these SOEs are remunerated at regulated fees that are actually above current market rates in competitive public tenders, which raises questions about market distortion and efficient use of public funds.

Oirescon has been recently calling for greater transparency in the awarding of these contracts, especially in the context of European funds. Despite these calls, compliance has been inconsistent. This lack of transparency raises concerns about the efficient use of public and European funds.

### A broader view

The European Union has established [competition policies](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/en/sheet/82/competition-policy) to ensure a level playing field for businesses. These policies prohibit anti-competitive agreements and abuse of dominant market positions. The EU also has specific regulations concerning the treatment of SOEs to ensure they do not distort market competition. These rules are in place to maintain market integrity and to promote innovation and efficiency. Critical structural reforms, however, such as the transposition of the EU Services Directive, are still undeveloped.

Research indicates that the absence of competition can have various effects on the market. According to [studies by the OECD](https://www.oecd.org/daf/competition/46734249.pdf), SOEs with a privileged position can negatively affect competition, posing challenges to private businesses and existing policy frameworks. In the short term, this can lead to increased costs for public projects. In the long term, it may hinder innovation and efficiency in the sector.

Furthermore, firms like INECO and TRAGSA are not limited to domestic operations; they also compete internationally against private Spanish firms. This dual role of the state as both a market facilitator and a competitor could have implications for the principles of free market and competition.

The increasing trend of direct contracting to SOEs has both short-term and long-term implications. In the short term, it can discourage participation from private firms, leading to less competitive pricing and potentially higher costs for public projects. In the long term, this practice could result in market stagnation and reduced competitiveness for Spanish firms on a global scale.

Spain has very talented and competitive civil engineering professionals and firms, who are very capable of addressing the country's needs and serving as a foundation for sustainable living. But we clearly need a radically more transparent, rational and long-term looking way of spending public money to realise the value of the services we provide.
