Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) have long been celebrated as a solution for infrastructure development challenges. However, as we navigate the intricate landscape of modern infrastructure, it's crucial to question the assumptions that fuel the expectations.

In my previous seven-part series about PPPs, I explored the theoretical benefits and practical challenges of this form of infrastructure delivery, from [increased access to financing](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ppp-crisis-part-four-financing-jose-cordovilla/) to efficiency gains and governance upsides. In the case of access to financing, one particular aspect that deserves attention is the concept of "**fiscal illusions**," a phenomenon that can significantly distort our understanding of the true costs and benefits of PPPs.

In this article I write some thoughts about it. If you woud like to explore the matter in greater detail, the IMF published in 2021 a [very interesting paper](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/Departmental-Papers-Policy-Papers/Issues/2021/05/10/Mastering-the-Risky-Business-of-Public-Private-Partnerships-in-Infrastructure-50335) that elaborates on this concept.

### The Allure and Pitfalls of Financing

The immediate influx of capital that PPPs often bring can be incredibly seductive. Governments, eager to show progress and deliver on electoral promises, may find the allure of quick financing too good to let go. However, this focus on short-term gains usually overlooks the long-term fiscal commitments that come with PPPs. In the article on financing in PPPs mentioned earlier, I discussed the potential for increased access to capital. ^0a9b56

Yet, one must remember that this **capital isn't free**. Long-term liabilities such as availability payments, revenue-sharing agreements, and contingent liabilities can have significant fiscal implications. There are very interesting publications on this subject, such as the IMF's [Mastering the Risky Business of Public-Private Partnerships in Infrastructure](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/Departmental-Papers-Policy-Papers/Issues/2021/05/10/Mastering-the-Risky-Business-of-Public-Private-Partnerships-in-Infrastructure-50335), a paper that studies fiscals risks and management strategies. The well-known [PPP Reference Guide](https://ppp.worldbank.org/public-private-partnership/library/public-private-partnerships-reference-guide-version-30) by the World Bank also provides an in-depth look at how the long-term commitments of PPPs can affect the fiscal health of a project and its grantor.

### The Complex Equation of Value for Money in PPPs

A concept that often takes centre stage in PPPs is "value for money". It is a term that encapsulates a multitude of expectations and assumptions, from efficiency and innovation to cost-effectiveness and delivery assurance. However, as I discussed in my article about [the efficiency gains](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ppp-crisis-part-five-efficiency-jose-cordovilla/) expected from private sector participation, the concept of value for money is far from straightforward.

In the traditional sense, value for money is often equated with immediate financial metrics such as cost savings or return on investment. However, this narrow focus can be misleading, and the oversight can lead to projects that appear financially viable in the short term but become burdensome liabilities in the long run.

> True value for money should encompass the entire lifecycle of the project, from the initial planning and construction phases to long-term operation and maintenance.

Moreover, the value for money equation must also consider the adaptability and resilience of the project. In an era marked by rapid technological advancements, risk complexity and increasing environmental concerns, the ability of a project to adapt to unforeseen challenges is crucial. Whether it's integrating new technologies or making adjustments to cope with climate change, a project's adaptability can significantly impact its long-term value.

In summary, achieving true value for money in PPPs requires a comprehensive, strategic approach that goes beyond immediate economic and financial metrics. It calls for a nuanced understanding that considers the full lifecycle costs and the long-term adaptability of the project.

### Transparency in Public-Private Partnerships: A difficult, yet necessary balance

Transparency is often hailed as the cornerstone of good governance and is particularly crucial in the context of PPPs. I have long emphasized the importance of transparency, a theme that is featured prominently in my separate article on public procurement in infrastructure, [**"The Paradox of Transparency"**](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/paradox-transparency-jose-cordovilla/).

Transparency is a double-edged sword. While it can serve as a powerful tool for accountability and stakeholder engagement, it can also lead to information overload. As discussed in that article the sheer volume of data can make it difficult for stakeholders, including the public, to discern what is truly important. This paradox becomes even more pronounced in PPPs, which often involve complex financial structures and long-term commitments.

Transparency International's brief on [**"Corruption and Unsolicited Proposals"**](https://knowledgehub.transparency.org/helpdesk/corruption-and-unsolicited-proposals-risks-accountability-and-best-practices) adds another layer to this phenomenon. Unsolicited proposals have grown in popularity as an innovative, cost-saving type of public-private partnership. However, the unsolicited, sometimes secretive, nature of these projects and the barriers to traditional competition make them vulnerable to corruption risks. While transparency is essential for combating corruption and ensuring accountability, it must be accompanied by the capacity to interpret and act upon the information disclosed, which must be rigorously and strategically managed for the benefit of the public. In other words, transparency is not an end in itself but a means to achieve more accountable and effective governance.

> Achieving meaningful transparency in PPPs requires a balanced approach. It's not just about disclosing data but making that data understandable, actionable, and relevant to the stakeholders involved.

This nuanced approach to transparency aligns with the broader themes of governance and accountability that I have been writing about.

### Concluding Thoughts

I am a strong supporter for PPPs because I genuinely believe in the benefits of private sector participation in delivering and managing infrastructure. The are a powerful tool that, as the saying goes, must be handled with great responsibility. It is crucial to critically examine and address the potential pitfalls so that the model evolves and gains the legitimacy it deserves, if governed appropriately. A very common pitfall we must be aware of is the fiscal illusions that can distort the understanding of these complex ventures.

By taking a more nuanced approach that considers both the immediate gains and the long-term implications, we will make more informed, strategic decisions that align with the broader goals of sustainable development and fiscal responsibility. This approach resonates much with the themes of transparency, governance, and long-term planning.

# La odisea de entender los PGE | LinkedIn

> ## Excerpt
> Cada año, desde hace un tiempo, paso por el mismo trance: Se empieza a hablar de los Presupuestos Generales del Estado (PGE) en los medios de comunicación y despierta en mí de repente ese espíritu de ciudadano involucrado, de contribuyente exigente que quiere conocer cómo y en qué se utiliza el dinero de todos en este país.

Cada año, desde hace un tiempo, paso por el mismo trance: Se empieza a hablar de los Presupuestos Generales del Estado (PGE) en los medios de comunicación y despierta en mí de repente ese espíritu de ciudadano involucrado, de contribuyente exigente que quiere conocer cómo y en qué se utiliza el dinero de todos en este país.

Y cada año me dispongo, valiente, a explorar los documentos del PGE, armado de buenas intenciones y una curiosidad tremenda por resolver esas preguntas que me asaltan de vez en cuando -especialmente cuando presento mis liquidaciones de impuestos-, y que de repente se me atropellan todas a una al escuchar la palabra mágica "_PGE_":

-   ¿Cuánto dinero público gestiona el Estado? (esta pregunta no encuentra respuesta obvia, como verás más abajo)
-   ¿Cuántos impuestos se recaudan en realidad, de los múltiples tipos que pagamos? IVA, sociedades, patrimonio, combustibles, etc..
-   ¿Son los impuestos la principal fuente de ingresos del Estado?
-   ¿Dónde queda la deuda pública en el presupuesto, y qué impacto tiene en los ingresos y gastos totales? Se menciona con frecuencia la ratio de deuda pública sobre el PIB, pero no se habla tanto del porcentaje que supone la deuda pública sobre el total de ingresos (y de gastos en el pago).
-   ¿Cuánto se destina a costear el aparato funcionarial y el [tremendo entramado](https://www.pap.hacienda.gob.es/invente2/PagMenuPrincipalV2.aspx?OhnFWe2YpwVSRRIMqh5QkA==) de entes y empresas públicas centrales, autonómicas y locales con que contamos en España?
-   ¿Qué proporción de los presupuestos se destina a las pensiones, al subsidio de paro o a la inversión, en el conjunto del país?

Y como cada año, después de deambular por el laberinto de la estructura documental de los PGE, tomando algunas notas e intentando en vano atar cabos para llegar a una visión general y coherente del dinero público, me doy por vencido y tiro la toalla.

> ..cada año, después de deambular por el laberinto de los PGE, tomar notas e intentar en vano atar cabos para llegar a una visión coherente del dinero público, me doy por vencido y tiro la toalla

¿Te ha sucedido a ti? ¿Acaso no me crees?

Te invito a [visitar la web principal de los PGE 2021](https://www.sepg.pap.hacienda.gob.es/Presup/PGE2021Proyecto/MaestroDocumentos/PGE-ROM/Series.htm) del Ministerio de Hacienda, donde puedes experimentar la yinkana de las Series Roja, Verde, Amarilla, Gris y Azul de los presupuestos, con su laberinto de carpetas y subcarpetas, sus tablas entreveradas de capítulos, secciones y epígrafes y su exquisita formalidad terminológica.

Uno esperaría encontrar, por aquello de que estamos en el año 2021, algún resumen informativo, explicado con palabras y gráficos entendibles por cualquier ciudadano de a pie, donde se pueda leer en qué consisten los PGE y para qué se emplean, como por ejemplo hace [este infográfico del gobierno de EEUU](https://www.usa.gov/budget#item-213709). O quizás alguna aplicación web donde explorar y visualizar gráficamente o descargar conjuntos de datos relevantes para el análisis, que es algo normal y corriente en el año 2021. Pero no.

![No alt text provided for this image](https://www.linkedin.com//:0)

En su lugar, la versión "digital" y supuestamente más informativa que publica el Estado es el [documento de presentación](https://www.sepg.pap.hacienda.gob.es/sitios/sepg/es-ES/Presupuestos/PGE/ProyectoPGE2021/Documents/LIBROAMARILLO2021.pdf) de los presupuestos, que tiene la friolera de 434 páginas, un resumen ejecutivo sin gráficos ni tablas resumen -valga la redundancia-, y donde hay que navegar hasta el Cuadro III.1.3 de la página 98 para encontrarse con la madre de todas las tablas: la que contiene la cifra mágica, **EL TOTAL: Los 550 mil millones de euros de dinero público que maneja el Estado**. Incluyendo la deuda, sí, porque el Estado se endeuda a cargo de la riqueza que los ciudadanos generaremos en el futuro. Digo esto porque en numerosas notas informativas y noticias las cifras que se mencionan curiosamente no incluyen la deuda, como si fuese poco relevante (en realidad es más bien al contrario, ver más abajo) o un concepto etéreo que no nos atañe.

Y aún si tienes tiempo y ganas de leer el documento de presentación, difícilmente aprenderás en qué cosas tangibles, de la calle, de nuestra vida cotidiana, se gasta la mayor parte del dinero público. Para tener una idea aproximada sin morir en el intento hay que acudir a los medios, donde otros viajeros de la odisea escriben [resúmenes muy informativos](https://www.libremercado.com/2020-10-31/los-presupuestos-de-2021-paso-a-paso-asi-se-distribuye-el-gasto-del-estado-6676169/). En cualquier caso, necesitarás una buena dosis de atención para absorber los conceptos.

¿Por qué tiene el contribuyente que dedicar horas para entender los PGE? La transparencia de verdad (frente a la de _boquilla_) no consiste meramente en publicar datos e informes. Consiste en facilitar a los interesados el acceso a información actualizada, clara, comprensible y relevante sobre las cuestiones que más les afectan. Los PGE no son transparentes porque no son información útil ni accesible para el ciudadano: son documentos contables enrevesados que meramente justifican el complejísimo aparato público del país.

> Los PGE no son transparentes, porque no son información útil ni accesible para el ciudadano: son documentos contables que meramente justifican el complejísimo aparato público del país.

**PERO ESTE AÑO ME HE NEGADO A TIRAR LA TOALLA**. Me he empeñado hasta encontrar respuesta a esas preguntas que me hago sistemáticamente y poner un poco de luz sobre el tema. Entre noviembre de 2020 y enero del 2021 me he reservado ratos para estudiar los documentos oficiales, leer artículos de prensa y hacer mis propios cálculos (sumas, restas y porcentajes, nada sofisticado), combinando datos de distintos libros y capítulos y comprobando que las cifras cuadran.

El resultado de mi odisea se resume en la gráfica de abajo y los puntos que la siguen. He omitido el desglose de cada partida por simplificación.

![Presupuestos Generales del Estado 2021](https://www.linkedin.com//:0)

1.  Quinientos cincuenta mil millones de euros, un 47% del PIB, están en manos de la administración pública. Es decir, <u>el sector público maneja prácticamente la mitad de la riqueza del país</u>, y una parte muy importante es en forma de deuda.
2.  <u>La mayor partida de ingresos públicos en España viene del endeudamiento</u>: nada menos que un 36%. Se trata principalmente de bonos que se emiten en los mercados de capital y compran inversores a cambio de pagos futuros. Por cierto, en esos pagos futuros se incluye la famosa prima de riesgo.
3.  La mitad de los ingresos provienen de los impuestos (27%) y las cotizaciones a la seguridad social que pagan las empresas y los autónomos (23%). Otros ingresos como los cobros de tasas son relativamente menores en comparación (3%).
4.  Los 27.000 millones de euros que se espera recibir en 2021 de los [fondos europeos de recuperación](https://www.lamoncloa.gob.es/presidente/actividades/Paginas/2020/espana-puede.aspx) suponen aproximadamente un 5% de los ingresos.
5.  Casi una tercera parte (31%) del gasto va a la Seguridad Social, principalmente para costear las pensiones (la friolera de 145.000 millones) y prestaciones de incapacidad, familia, dependencia, etc.
6.  El capítulo con el curioso nombre de **"Transferencias Corrientes"** y que ocupa una cuarta parte del gasto, merece la pena un poco de atención: incluye el gasto en subsidio por paro (6% del presupuesto), la transferencia de fondos a las CCAA (8%) y entes locales (3%), asuntos exteriores (3%) y otros. Ojo al dato: **España gasta casi 18.000 millones de euros en asuntos exteriores** (embajadas, consulados, ONU y similares), casi lo mismo que en educación y varias veces lo que se invierte en infraestructuras.
7.  El "Activo Financiero" que aparece en gastos son préstamos que hace el Estado a otros gobiernos y entes, incluida la Seguridad Social (he aquí otra vuelta de tuerca en el entramado presupuestario). Suponen cerca de 40.000 millones de euros, un 7% del total.
8.  Por otro lado, las "Transferencias de Capital" incluyen la financiación de grandes **empresas públicas** como IDAE, ADIF, CDTI o RENFE, que nos cuestan en conjunto 15.000 millones, además de transferencias a CCAA, ayuntamientos y diputaciones para proyectos de inversión.
9.  Los repagos de deuda y sus intereses a nuestros acreedores aparecen en los capítulos de pasivo financiero (17%) y gastos financieros (6%), respectivamente. Un vistazo rápido al gráfico para comparar ingresos por endeudamiento con repagos de deuda revela que en 2021 va a entrar mucha más deuda de la que saldrá. Es decir, nos vamos a endeudar **mucho**.
10.  Los gastos de personal de las administraciones (25.000 millones) están en el capítulo de Gastos Operativos, y suponen cerca del 5% del total.

> España gasta casi 18.000 millones de euros en asuntos exteriores (embajadas, consulados, ONU y similares), casi lo mismo que en educación y el doble que en inversión productiva.

Una última y triste conclusión es que **tan solo 2.900 millones de euros se destinarán en 2021 a la inversión directa en infraestructuras**, a repartir entre la construcción de nuevas y la renovación de las existentes.

Ahí están los datos. Dejo para otro momento los análisis pormenorizados y las valoraciones sobre la idoneidad, la sostenibilidad o la coherencia de los presupuestos. Me quedo con que este año mi odisea ha tenido un final más feliz. Los Presupuestos Generales del Estado me son un poco menos incomprensibles. Eso sí, tras la curiosidad ha venido la intranquilidad. Pero más vale estar informado, porque en las cuestiones del dinero público no tiene cabida aquel refrán de "ojos que no ven...".

Por último, espero de verdad no tener que vivir -ni yo ni nadie- la odisea de nuevo en los próximos años y celebraré que el Estado se tome un interés genuino en informar clara y sencillamente sobre cómo gestiona nuestros impuestos y el patrimonio público.

Me encantará recibir tus comentarios, sugerencias o correcciones a erratas en las cifras y observaciones que escribo en este artículo. J

> [!summary] Operational Risk in PPPs, in the age of climate and technosocial complex
> As we venture further into the 21st century, the complexities surrounding Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in infrastructure development are growing exponentially.

---
As we venture further into the 21st century, the complexities surrounding Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in infrastructure development are growing exponentially.

In a previous seven-chapter [series of articles](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ppp-crisis-part-one-intro-jose-cordovilla?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_ios&utm_campaign=share_via), I critically examined the theoretical benefits and practical challenges of PPPs, concluding that while the model holds promise, it also comes with its own set of intricacies that require nuanced understanding, leadership, greater transparency and adaptive strategies.

In this new article I want to rekindle that discussion by focusing on the evolving landscape of operational risks, particularly in the context of technological interconnectedness, artificial intelligence, climate change, and resource scarcity. Here are some preliminary thoughts about the topic.

### The Evolving Nature of Operational Risks

Traditionally, operational risks in PPPs have encompassed issues like project delays, cost overruns, and governance challenges. However, as we navigate an increasingly interconnected world, new dimensions of operational risks have emerged. These risks are not just confined to the operational phase but can manifest at various stages of a PPP project, from planning and construction to maintenance and decommissioning.

### Technological Interconnectedness: A Web of Complexity

The advent of technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), big data analytics, and blockchain has revolutionized the way infrastructure projects are managed. These technologies offer substantial opportunities for efficiency gains and innovation but also introduce new vulnerabilities. Cybersecurity risks, data privacy concerns, and the potential for technological failures can have cascading effects on PPP projects. For instance, a cyber-attack on a smart grid project could not only disrupt electricity supply but also compromise data integrity and erode public trust.

### Artificial Intelligence: The Double-Edged Sword

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly being integrated into infrastructure projects for predictive maintenance, real-time monitoring, and automated decision-making. However, the use of AI also introduces new operational risks. Algorithmic biases, ethical dilemmas, and the "black box" nature of some AI algorithms can result in unintended consequences. Moreover, the rapid pace of AI development means that PPP contracts may need frequent updates, adding another layer of complexity to project management.

### Climate Change: The Unpredictable Variable

Climate change introduces a significant operational risk by adding a layer of uncertainty to long-term infrastructure projects. Extreme weather events can cause project delays, increase costs, and even result in the failure of critical infrastructure. The need for climate-resilient infrastructure is no longer a choice but a necessity. PPPs must now incorporate climate adaptation measures, which could range from using sustainable materials to designing infrastructure that can withstand extreme weather conditions.

### Resource Scarcity: The Looming Crisis

Resource scarcity, particularly in the context of water and raw materials, is another emerging operational risk. Scarcity can lead to increased costs, supply chain disruptions, and even project abandonment. Sustainable resource management practices must be incorporated into PPP projects to ensure their long-term viability.

### Towards a Holistic Approach to Managing Operational Risks

Given the increasing complexity brought about by these factors, a holistic approach to managing operational risks is imperative. This involves not just traditional risk assessment methodologies but also adaptive strategies that can respond to rapidly changing scenarios. I believe transparency, stakeholder engagement, and a focus on sustainability should act as guiding principles.

The operational risks in Public-Private Partnerships have evolved, influenced by a host of factors that reflect our changing world. While the promise of PPPs remains compelling, a nuanced understanding of these new-age operational risks is crucial for the model's long-term success. By acknowledging and planning for these complexities, we can better harness the potential of PPPs to deliver infrastructure that is not just efficient and cost-effective but also resilient and sustainable.

By diving deep into these complexities, we can begin to formulate strategies that are adaptive, resilient, and aligned with the broader goals of sustainable development and social well-being. It's a challenging task, but one that is essential as we navigate the intricate landscape of modern infrastructure development.

More ideas will follow. Critical opinions will be welcome.

> [!summary] Spain's civil engineering sector: Competent but uncompetitive
> Today I was reading a post by my colleague Juan Carlos Bravo Recio, whom I regularly follow. It was about the annual report published by Spain's Independent Office for Regulation and Supervision of Public Procurement (Oirescon) and the striking facts and figures about direct contracting of engineering services to State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs).

Today I was reading [a post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7110910583469666304?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7110910583469666304%29) by my colleague [Juan Carlos Bravo Recio](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juan-carlos-bravo-recio-5a406110/), whom I regularly follow. It was about the annual report published by Spain's Independent Office for Regulation and Supervision of Public Procurement ([Oirescon](https://www.hacienda.gob.es/es-ES/Oirescon/Paginas/ias.aspx)) and the striking facts and figures about direct contracting of engineering services to State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs).

The report findings, very usefully summarised in [an article published by business newspaper Cinco Días](https://cincodias.elpais.com/companias/2023-09-22/tragsa-e-ineco-al-frente-del-boom-del-contrato-directo-de-la-administracion.html), show that the volume of direct contracts (without competition) awarded to SOEs like INECO and TRAGSA has increased significantly from the previous year. This surge in direct contracting has been met with strong criticism from private engineering firms, such as my employer, who argue that **a large portion of this work should be open to competitive bidding**.

**Of course it should,** unless rigorously and transparently justified otherwise, be open to competitive bidding, always. This if for the benefit of 1) our citizens, ultimate recipients of the services we provide as engineering professionals; 2) our current and future professional talent; 3) our businesses and economy. I would like to share some initial thoughts on why I think so. For the debate.

### A competent but uncompetitive sector

Spain's civil engineering sector is a mature market with a wide range of private [[CONSULTING FIRMS|consulting firms]]. These firms vary in size and have been instrumental in the country's infrastructure development and our international competitve strengths today in the sector.

In Spain, SOEs such as INECO and TRAGSA have historically been large recipients of public contracts without undergoing a competitive bidding process, but the latest trend is taking us into worrying territory. In 2022, SOEs received contracts worth €2.631 billion, marking a 62% increase compared to 2021. The number of contracts directly awarded also rose from 1,888 in 2021 to 2,773 in 2022. ^spain-soes-spending

The government's rationale for this approach includes the speed of project execution and the ability to maintain tighter control over the service provider. On the other hand, however, these SOEs are remunerated at regulated fees that are actually above current market rates in competitive public tenders, which raises questions about market distortion and efficient use of public funds.

Oirescon has been recently calling for greater transparency in the awarding of these contracts, especially in the context of European funds. Despite these calls, compliance has been inconsistent. This lack of transparency raises concerns about the efficient use of public and European funds.

### A broader view

The European Union has established [competition policies](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/en/sheet/82/competition-policy) to ensure a level playing field for businesses. These policies prohibit anti-competitive agreements and abuse of dominant market positions. The EU also has specific regulations concerning the treatment of SOEs to ensure they do not distort market competition. These rules are in place to maintain market integrity and to promote innovation and efficiency. Critical structural reforms, however, such as the transposition of the EU Services Directive, are still undeveloped.

Research indicates that the absence of competition can have various effects on the market. According to [studies by the OECD](https://www.oecd.org/daf/competition/46734249.pdf), SOEs with a privileged position can negatively affect competition, posing challenges to private businesses and existing policy frameworks. In the short term, this can lead to increased costs for public projects. In the long term, it may hinder innovation and efficiency in the sector.

Furthermore, firms like INECO and TRAGSA are not limited to domestic operations; they also compete internationally against private Spanish firms. This dual role of the state as both a market facilitator and a competitor could have implications for the principles of free market and competition.

The increasing trend of direct contracting to SOEs has both short-term and long-term implications. In the short term, it can discourage participation from private firms, leading to less competitive pricing and potentially higher costs for public projects. In the long term, this practice could result in market stagnation and reduced competitiveness for Spanish firms on a global scale.

Spain has very talented and competitive civil engineering professionals and firms, who are very capable of addressing the country's needs and serving as a foundation for sustainable living. But we clearly need a radically more transparent, rational and long-term looking way of spending public money to realise the value of the services we provide.

> [!summary] Introduction
> On September 16th and 17th I had the opportunity to attend the 2024 Global Summit of the International Toll Road Association (IBTTA) in Sevilla. As a first-time attendee, I am very glad with my decision to attend and definitely plan to do so next year. I recommend this annual gathering (the host country changes each year) to anyone involved in the policy-making, planning, financing or operation of high-capacity roads. My congratulations to the organisers, sponsors and hosts. Pat Jones, Bill M. Halkias, PE, F.ASCE, F.ITE and the IBTTA team did a fantastic job.

On September 16th and 17th I had the opportunity to attend the 2024 Global Summit of the International Toll Road Association ([IBTTA](https://www.linkedin.com/article/edit/7243651397307518977/#)) in Sevilla. As a first-time attendee, I am very glad with my decision to attend and definitely plan to do so next year. I recommend this annual gathering (the host country changes each year) to anyone involved in the policy-making, planning, financing or operation of high-capacity roads. My congratulations to the organisers, sponsors and hosts. [Pat Jones](https://www.linkedin.com/article/edit/7243651397307518977/#), [Bill M. Halkias, PE, F.ASCE, F.ITE](https://www.linkedin.com/article/edit/7243651397307518977/#) and the IBTTA team did a fantastic job.

With a significant focus on road safety, road user charges (RUC), and the evolution of public-private partnerships (PPPs) in tolling operations, the summit provided a platform to analyze the future of toll roads. This was particularly relevant to my role as the Director of Infrastructure Advisory Services at [TYPSA](https://www.linkedin.com/company/typsa/), where we are constantly seeking to integrate our technical excellence into sustainable infrastructure solutions for our clients and stakeholders.

In this article I want to share with you the key ideas that were presented and discussed during the two days at the Summit. I also want to add my own analysis and reflections on a highly strategic and complex matter of our time: **road management models that deliver safety, affordability, resilience and sustainability -both environmental and financial**. Do contact me or provide your opinion below to engage in the debate.

## Key topics discussed

The 2024 global summit of the International Toll Road Association (IBTTA) presented a range of key topics focused on the future of tolling, road user charging (RUC), and sustainable mobility. Here are the main themes discussed:

1.  **Road safety:** Attendees and organisers systematically highlighted road satefy as a critical issue, particularly focusing on integrating **advanced technology and data-driven solutions** into toll road operations to enhance safety.
    
2.  **Smart Tolling and Multi-Lane Free Flow (MLFF) Systems**: Countries around the world, including Indonesia and Europe, are advancing towards fully automated toll systems using technologies like MLFF and satellite-based GNSS systems. This shift aims to replace traditional toll booths, enhancing efficiency and reducing congestion.
    
3.  **Sustainability and Road User Charging (RUC)**: The summit highlighted a growing trend toward using RUC to address climate and sustainability challenges. This included emissions-based tolling systems that charge users based on vehicle emissions (e.g., CO2) under the "polluter pays" principle. Several presentations discussed the implementation of Eurovignette, a system designed to apply tolls based on vehicle emissions and distance travelled in the EU road network.
    
4.  **Technological Innovations and AI**: Digitalization of traffic management through the integration of artificial intelligence (AI), big data, and advanced sensor technologies were emphasized as essential tools to manage traffic, reduce accidents, and improve environmental outcomes. These technologies are becoming integral to addressing congestion and pollution issues, especially in urban areas. It is worth mentioning that the IBTTA AI and Machine Learning Subcommittee presented their [2023 integrated report](https://my.ibtta.org/portals/0/assets/downloads/IBTTA-AI-Machine-Learning-Subcommittee-2023-2024-Use-Case-Booklet.pdf) with in-depth analyses on the relevance of these technologies to different aspects of road management: financing, infrastructure management, traffic, cybersecurity and customer satisfaction.
    
5.  **The Future of Road Concessions and PPPs**: There was a significant focus on the evolving role of Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in road management, particularly as governments explore new concession models post-expiration of many of the existing high-capacity road PPPs that were contracted between the 80's and the global financial crisis. The discussions included scenarios for renewing toll road contracts, the introduction of free-flow tolling, and the role of private entities in long-term maintenance and modernization.
    
6.  **Challenges of Harmonizing RUC in Europe**: The discussions acknowledged the fragmented nature of tolling systems across Europe, with varying technologies and frameworks for light and heavy vehicles. There is an increasing push for harmonization, particularly through the European Electronic Toll Service (EETS), aiming to streamline tolling processes across member states.
    

> Overall, the summit emphasized the future of tolling as one driven by digital transformation, sustainability goals, and the need for more efficient and equitable road user charging systems.

### Road Safety

Road safety deserves special attention: it was a major theme at the IBTTA Summit, with a clear emphasis on how **smart infrastructure** and **real-time data** could significantly enhance road safety outcomes. Discussions highlighted the role of **connected vehicles**, **artificial intelligence**, and **predictive analytics** in preventing accidents and mitigating risks on toll roads. For instance, the use of **multi-lane free flow (MLFF) systems** allows for safer, smoother traffic, reducing the risk of rear-end collisions common in traditional toll booths.

**Smart Infrastructure**: The role of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) in reducing accidents by using sensor technologies and data analytics to monitor road conditions and driver behavior. This includes advancements in **AI-powered systems** to predict and prevent accidents by analyzing traffic patterns.

**Real-time Data and Predictive Safety**: Presentations highlighted the use of **big data and IoT** for real-time traffic monitoring, enabling road operators to respond quickly to incidents and prevent secondary accidents. This also includes predictive models to anticipate high-risk areas.

**Sustainable and Safe Mobility**: Several sessions linked safety with environmental sustainability, such as **emissions-based road charging** and the design of safer road environments as part of broader sustainability initiatives.

**Global Best Practices**: Lessons from international toll road operations, particularly in Europe and Asia, where **multi-lane free flow** (MLFF) tolling systems contribute to safer, smoother traffic by eliminating the need for vehicles to stop at toll booths, thus reducing rear-end collisions.

### Road User Charging (RUC)

As governments face **decreasing fuel tax revenues**, road user charging (RUC) is becoming essential for funding infrastructure. Charging by kilometers traveled, RUC faces challenges like public acceptance, political sensitivity, and complex technology. Effective implementation will require balancing privacy concerns with economic efficiency to ensure sustainable road funding. Specific notes on this topics:

-   **Transition to RUC Systems**: Governments are under pressure to replace the declining fuel tax revenues with kilometer-based RUC systems. This shift is being driven by the rise of electric vehicles and increasing fuel efficiency.
    
-   **Political Sensitivity and Public Acceptance**: RUC is seen as a controversial topic, particularly for light vehicles, due to public perception that it is used as a "cash cow" instead of being earmarked for road infrastructure improvements. A recurring topic is the need for governments to earmark part of RUC revenue for infrastructure maintenance to gain public acceptance and address the maintenance deficit.
    
-   **Technology and Efficiency**: Advanced technologies like GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite Systems) are being promoted as the leading solution for RUC. This is especially applicable to heavy goods vehicles (HGVs), with trials underway in several regions.
    
-   **Implementation Challenges**: Key challenges include ensuring economic efficiency and privacy compliance. A well-designed system must prevent significant administrative costs from eating into the revenue collected. Furthermore, a mix of different tolling systems (manual, DSRC, ANPR, GNSS) across regions complicates implementation.
    

### The Future of Concessions

> Many traditional toll road concessions are due to expire in the next 10 years, but the policies of the different governments with regards to who or how those roads will be operated and maintained are largely unclear. Ensuring smooth transitions requires innovative contractual and financial strategies and careful long-term planning.

-   **End of Traditional Concessions**: Many toll road concessions are nearing the end of their contractual periods, creating uncertainty about their renewal. Governments may choose not to renew some concessions, potentially leading to a lack of maintenance and operation (O&M) due to limited availability of public budget.
    
-   **PPP Models and Concession Evolution**: Concession models are evolving, with private-public partnerships (PPPs) being adapted to primarily focus on O&M and rehabilitation, rather than the broader development tasks traditionally included. The modular combination of tasks allows for more flexibility in financing.
    
-   **Risks of Transition**: As governments explore the generalization of RUC, they face a risk of political resistance. Additionally, if concessions end without proper renewal plans, there may be a decline in the quality of road maintenance.

## Reflections on the future of road management and financing

Here are some reflections and considerations concerning road user charges (RUC) and private operation models like concessions and Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), from the stimulating exchange of information and discussions at the 2024 IBTTA Global Summit, and my own experience as an infrastructure advisor.

### Balancing Commitment and Flexibility in Concession Models

One of the issues that generates more expectations, debate and controversy in the infrastructure arena is Concessions and PPPs. I have written extensively about the [need for better private participation models](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ppp-crisis-final-chapter-evolution-jose-cordovilla/) that address past mistakes, the [fiscal illusion trap](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/fiscal-illusions-public-private-partnerships-jose-cordovilla/) or the fascinating matter of [operational risk](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ppp-operational-risk-age-climate-technosocial-complex-jose-cordovilla/) in the age of climate and technosocial complex.

The history of private participation in infrastructure since the development of railways in the US in the 19th century reveals that a primary challenge in infrastructure regulation, especially in PPPs and concession models, is the balance between **commitment and flexibility**. Governments need to provide sufficient certainty to private operators regarding tariff structures and operational parameters (such as toll rates), which enables long-term investment. However, the concession contracts must also have built-in flexibility to adjust to unexpected economic, technological, or political changes, protecting the parties -and, ultimately, users and taxpayers- from opportunistic behaviours. By the way, if you have not read Prof. Gómez Ibánez [masterpiece on Infrastructure Regulation](https://www.gsd.harvard.edu/publication/regulating-infrastructure-monopoly-contracts-and-discretion/), you should.

In the context of **sustainability and emissions-based tolling**, this is critical. As countries adopt **dynamic pricing models** that account for environmental impact (like CO2 emissions), contracts will need mechanisms to adapt to new regulations and technologies. For instance, toll rates might need to be recalibrated periodically to reflect changes in vehicle technology, emissions standards, or traffic patterns. Contracts lacking flexibility could face renegotiations or disputes, which have historically undermined infrastructure partnerships.

### The Importance of Regulatory Stability

Historically, one of the risks in long-term PPPs has been the potential for **regulatory opportunism**, where governments revise toll or tariff structures unilaterally or introduce unanticipated requirements, especially under political pressure from users (i.e., motorists) or in response to public outcry over rising tolls or technological progress.

The 2024 Summit discussed the growing reliance on **road user charging** (RUC) and **technologically-driven tolling systems** (such as MLFF and GNSS-based systems). In this context, maintaining **regulatory stability** becomes even more critical to ensure private investors, suppliers and contractors can recover their investments without facing undue political risk.

> Governments should design regulatory frameworks that insulate private operators from drastic political changes, while still allowing for adjustments in line with sustainability goals (such as reducing carbon emissions).

This is no minor issue: it is a fact seen in many countries that **over-regulation or sudden policy shifts** can lead to aversion among investors, driving them away from public infrastructure projects.

### Incentivising Efficient and Sustainable Operations

The success of **contract models in infrastructure** often depends on properly aligning incentives between the public and private sectors. The private operator must be incentivized not only to operate the toll roads efficiently but also to meet broader public goals such as reducing traffic congestion, enhancing safety, and promoting sustainability.

At the 2024 Summit, the emphasis on **emissions-based tolling** and **road safety** technology illustrates this principle. For these initiatives to succeed within a PPP framework, **performance-based contracts** are essential. These contracts could offer rewards or penalties based on achieving specific environmental or safety outcomes (e.g., lower emissions, reduced accident rates). This approach encourages private operators to invest in new technologies, such as **AI-powered safety systems** or **electric vehicle incentives**, which not only meet their financial goals but also align with public policy objectives.

### Use Government Guarantees with Caution

Government guarantees in PPPs can lead to inefficient outcomes if they are too generous, not only in terms of unfairly high returns for the private partner but also worse performance, from a reduction of the operator's incentive to perform efficiently, knowing that losses will be covered by the government.

> The 2024 Summit’s discussions on expanding road user charges and private sector involvement in a climate of mistrust about the benefits of PPP models highlight the need for carefully structured **risk-sharing** agreements.

New (or renewed) concessions should ensure that risks (e.g., fluctuating traffic volumes or changes in tolling technology) are fairly distributed between the public and private sectors. **Over-reliance on minimum revenue guarantees** can undermine the financial sustainability of the public sector, especially if traffic projections fail to materialize due to shifts towards greener transportation alternatives or teleworking, as was noted in post-pandemic traffic trends.

### Unbundling, Coordination and Competition

As I argue in [previous articles](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ppp-crisis-part-five-efficiency-jose-cordovilla/), it is about time that we stop thinking of an infrastructure service as a monolythic thing. A major infrastructure includes many different types of assets, functions and services, some of which can potentially benefit from private sector competition, and some that will probably not. In the toll road sector, this could apply to differentiating between **infrastructure maintenance** (potentially monopolistic) and **value-added services** (such as smart tolling or safety technology), where competition could enhance efficiency and innovation.

As highlighted in the 2024 Summit, **digital tolling** and **smart infrastructure** require integration of various service providers, from tech companies to traditional road maintenance operators. A regulatory framework that encourages **competition in these ancillary services**, while ensuring proper coordination with the monopolistic infrastructure operator, can lead to more innovative and cost-effective solutions.

I believe these principles should guide future PPPs and concession models, ensuring that both public and private stakeholders benefit while advancing the broader goals of equity, sustainability and road safety.

### _Summary of the IPFA event hosted by Solvere Infraestructuras on May 10, 2018. Madrid_

### **Introduction**

This [IPFA](http://www.ipfa.org/) event organised and hosted by [Solvere Infraestructuras](http://www.solvereglobal.com/) intended to create a space for debate and exchange of relevant ideas for public-private partnerships in Spanish roads, with special attention to the Radiales and the new Road Investment Plan (PIC) of the Ministry of Fomento (Public Works).

The venue was at full capacity and counted in approximately 70 professionals who represented broadly the road concessions sector, including the Government, construction companies, road operators, banks, insurers, rating agencies, investment funds and consulting firms.

![](https://www.linkedin.com//:0)

The starting point was: Road PPPs must have technical and financial sustainability, but also - and no less important - generate long-term value and reinforce the legitimacy of such an infrastructure provision mechanism. This implies a significant change in the culture of the sector, towards greater collaboration and adaptability, innovating in how we work and how we take risks jointly, with greater transparency and boldness in the business approaches.

This spirit was reflected in the interventions of the speakers and attendees, who participated very actively in the debate.

**Speakers and Structure of the Session**

The session had the following speakers:

-   Gonzalo Ortiz, Technical Director, Sociedad Estatal de Infraestructuras del Transporte Terrestre ([SEITT](http://www.seittsa.es/seitt/lang_castellano/))
-   Fernando Lacasa, Head of Natural Resources & Infrastructure Iberia, [Société Générale](https://www.societegenerale.es/es/)
-   Nadia Franco, O&M Manager, [Acciona Concesiones](http://www.acciona-concesiones.com/)
-   Juan Ruiz de Velasco, CFO, [COPASA Concesiones](https://media.copasagroup.com/Pages/lineas/Concesiones/Concesiones.aspx)

![](https://www.linkedin.com//:0)

Jose Cordovilla, Managing Partner of [Solvere Infraestructuras](http://www.solvereglobal.com/) acted as moderator. In the first part, SEITT gave an overview of the new PIC and the future tenders for Radiales. SEITT and Société Générale shared their points of view and experiences on different aspects of road PPPs in Spain that were brought to the discussion. In the second part, Acciona and COPASA joined the panel and the debate was opened (as well as the possibility of asking questions) to the rest of the attendees.

## **Key Topics**

### **_<u>Scope of the PIC and Radiales</u>_**

The Radiales will be tendered as service concessions with total transfer of demand risk and a maximum duration of 25 years in 2 contracts:

1.  Radiales 2, 3, 4 and 5 together with the AP-36 Ocaña-La Roda, AP-41 Madrid-Toledo and M-12 Eje Aeropuerto
2.  Circunvalación de Alicante and the AP-7 Cartagena-Vera

The PIC roads will be tendered as public works concessions with a maximum term of 30 years, in 20 projects with investment values between 100 and 400 million euros. Payment mechanism will be availability, to provide commercial appeal to the contracts. The first two projects tendered will be the Murcia ring roads.

The European Investment Bank (EIB) will finance up to 50% of the investments, since they are part of the Trans-European Transport Network.

### **_<u>Commercial attractiveness of the projects</u>_**

The private sector pointed out that after a number of years (6-7) in which there have been no road concessions in Spain, and the problem of the bankruptcy of Radiales, there is a great interest in the tenders being prepared by Fomento. For the screening of projects, the private sector takes into account the size of the investment (minimum), the bankability, the economic sense of the project, participation of the EIB and other factors. On the other hand, there is strong competition due to the entry of institutional investors.

The Government will establish the contract duration based on the return of investments and market competition, since there must be explicit justification for any duration above the 5-year maximum term established by the new Law on Public Sector Contracts.

### **_<u>Main Risks</u>_**

![](https://www.linkedin.com//:0)

An interactive poll used during the event revealed that the main risks for the private sector are the cost / timeframes for land acquisition and demand risk, followed by technological disruption and construction risk. The availability risk and the possible shortage of capable professionals in the sector are considered marginal.

### **_<u>Land Acquisition</u>_**

In the PIC it seems the proposal will be that the State assume the excess costs of land acquisition between 150% and 250%, but not lower or higher than those thresholds. In the past, the private sector relied on the Responsabilidad Patrimonial de la Administración as a safety net for investments. The problems with the determination of the RPA in Radiales will probably cause the risks to be analysed more meticulously in the future.

### **_<u>Availability Payment</u>_**

The PIC contract documents will include 15 performance indicators. Given the past experience with availability indicators (complexity in actual management, especially in terms of response times), the structure of indicators has been simplified with respect to previous projects (28 in the case of Benavente-Zamora, 2012) and the General Directorate of Roads will be in charge of monitoring these.

![](https://www.linkedin.com//:0)

The availability payment for PIC projects will include a deduction in case the demand is lower than expected. The legal services of the Government have determined that, in order to consider the contract as ‘concesión de obras’ -based on the new Law on Public Sector Contracts of 2017- there must be demand risk in addition to availability on the private side, since it is interpreted that the availability - as defined by the existing indicators - does not constitute full transfer of supply risk.

The deduction mechanism that is proposed is up to 10% deduction of the availability fee if the demand drops to 40% of the forecasts, and up to 25% deduction if the drop in demand is 50%\*.

\*This text was edited to reflect the correct thresholds.

### **_<u>Technological disruption</u>_**

The feasibility studies of the PIC do not incorporate the possible impact of technological changes such as the autonomous vehicle or MaaS (mobility as a service), since they are considered emerging, untested technologies.

The Radiales contracts and the PIC will only consider the possibility of re-equilibrium due to technological changes in cases where the obligation of new investments or incurring higher costs come from decisions by the contracting administration (i.e. the Ministry of Fomento). This would be the case of updates required as a result of new tunnels safety regulations, but would not apply to new requirements imposed by the Ministry of Industry, for example.

![](https://www.linkedin.com//:0)

The concessionaire companies are considering innovations such as the monitored highway toward the upcoming tenders, but the experience of innovative initiatives in the past has not been satisfactory and the private sector understands that it has to arise at the request of the Administration.

The event attendees considered that autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence and mobility as a service are the technologies with the greatest potential for disruption in road PPPs, far beyond new construction materials, electric vehicles or the introduction of open data policies.

### **_<u>Governance</u>_**

It became obvious the concern of the sector about the social opposition to private participation in infrastructure management, wrongly named "privatisation". The session saw an interesting discussion about how to strengthen the legitimacy of this public service provision mechanism.

![](https://www.linkedin.com//:0)

It was highlighted the need for greater efforts in transparency, making more information publicly available on the real figures of roads with private operation, so that the public perceives in a clear way that infrastructures are costly to maintain and operate, and that private participation can bring benefits to the quality of the service.

The discussion also emphasised the importance of dedicating greater efforts and resources to the preparatory stages of the projects, for a better structuring of the PPPs.

### **_<u>Closing of the Session</u>_**

The event finished with an informative note by Agata Skrzypczak (IPFA European Operations Manager) on the IPFA activities internationally and in Spain, followed by a lively networking drinks reception sponsored by Solvere.

> [!abstract] The case for redundancy in infrastructure
> Raising funds for large-scale infrastructure investments is quite a task. Even if the socioeconomic cost-benefit analysis confirms the advantage of a particular investment, even with the social and environmental safeguards fully vetted and the benefit of public opinion for it, there is still the long struggle of securing the big amount, in competition with a myriad other public projects, goods and services to meet the growing demand of the population.

Raising funds for large-scale infrastructure investments is quite a task. Even if the socioeconomic cost-benefit analysis confirms the advantage of a particular investment, even with the social and environmental safeguards fully vetted and the benefit of public opinion for it, there is still the long struggle of securing the big amount, in competition with a myriad other public projects, goods and services to meet the growing demand of the population.

Now, imagine having to raise funds for an infrastructure that somehow duplicates the function of an existing one, in fact becoming a redundant infrastructure. Why would you want to do that? The numbers certainly won't add up in the models. Resources are already scarce enough, and excess capacity goes against principles of efficiency and sustainability.

Now, let me question that view and the tyranny of economic models in decision-making, for a moment. Let me make something very clear: I am not for resource wasting, nor for reckless growth or irrational exuberance, and certainly not for "building stuff" just for the sake of maintaining jobs and firms in an industry with a standing tradition of inefficiency and lack of transparency. As a Spaniard I am well used to the cases of empty regional airports and underutilised high-speed rail lines that feed many of our political chats at home.

I am, however, **for questioning the conventional way of doings things**, especially when it comes to an issue as strategic as national infrastructure planning.

I may not get it completely right, but critical thinking is imperative when it comes to great challenges, so, for the sake of questioning, I will visit the case for redundant infrastructure.

### Beyond the numbers

National infrastructure is a complex, multifaceted challenge that transcends the economic models and financial metrics. It's a commitment that shapes the future of a nation, deeply rooted in a web of social, environmental, and geopolitical considerations.

Take, for instance, the transformative power of public transportation. More than just a means to get from one place to another, a well-designed transit system will serve as a catalyst for social cohesion. As new subway lines and bus routes weave through previously isolated neighborhoods, they do more than facilitate movement; they connect communities and foster a sense of shared destiny. Over time, these physical connections **can translate into a profound sense of social unity, breaking down barriers and creating a more inclusive society**. The success of such an endeavor isn't just measured in passenger numbers or revenue, but in the less tangible yet equally important metrics of public trust and community engagement.

### Redundancy = Bad ?

Infrastructure redundancy is a compelling topic, especially when viewed through the lens of economic resilience. Redundancy, often seen as an excess or duplication, can actually serve as a vital component in ensuring the robustness and resilience of a system.

> The notion of infrastructure as a strategic asset extends to the realm of national security.

Ports, highways, and energy grids are not merely conduits for trade and commerce; they are critical components of a nation's defense infrastructure. Their resilience against natural disasters, cyber-attacks, and other malicious or unintended shocks is paramount for maintaining national stability. The measures that incrase the robustness of these infrastructures against shocks becomes the yardstick by which we measure not just their utility, but their contribution to the nation's overall security posture. Redundancy is one important measure of this kind.

### Sustainability is also about Resilience

As we grapple with climate change, the environmental sustainability of our infrastructure projects takes on central importance. The decisions we make today—whether investing in renewable energy, implementing waste management systems, or designing eco-friendly urban spaces—will have a lasting impact on our planet's health. The metrics are shifting from short-term profitability to long-term sustainability, measured in carbon footprints reduced, waste efficiently managed, and renewable energy sources tapped.

On the other hand, the strategic importance of infrastructure isn't confined within a nation's borders; it extends to the geopolitical stage.

> Resilient infrastructure networks can significantly enhance a country's influence, facilitating trade and fostering diplomatic ties.

These networks become conduits for both economic and diplomatic relationships, serving as physical manifestations of strategic alliances and partnerships.

In the end, the ultimate goal of any infrastructure investment should be to elevate the quality of life for current and future generations. Therefore, the decisions to invest in large infrastructure projects are strategic movements that involve holistic consideration of various factors, each contributing to the overarching narrative of a nation's development. It is a story not just told in numbers and spreadsheets, but in the experiences lived by its people, the resilience of its communities and institutions, and the standing of their country on the global stage.

Now let us move from the ideallistic vision to the more practical exercise of some pros and cons of redundancy.

### Pros of Redundancy in Infrastructure

1. **Resilience**: Redundant systems are generally more resilient to shocks. In the context of trasnport infrastructure, for instance, having redundant networks means that if one route is compromised—due to natural disasters, accidents, or maintenance—the other can serve as an alternative. This is particularly important for emergency services and critical supply chains.

2. **Flexibility and Choice**: Redundancy provides options for different types of users. For instance, those who prioritize speed and are willing to pay may opt for toll roads or express lanes, while others who prefer a more scenic route or have budget constraints can use non-toll alternatives.

3. **Economic Opportunities**: Multiple routes can stimulate economic activity in different areas. Diversification can be beneficial for regional development.

4. **Demand Management**: Having more than one alternative can help distribute demand more evenly, reducing congestion. This is particularly useful during peak travel times or large-scale events.

5. **Future-Proofing**: As populations grow and infrastructure needs evolve, having extra capacity can be an advantage. It provides the system with the ability to adapt to increased demand without requiring immediate, costly upgrades.

### Cons of Redundancy in Infrastructure

1. **Resource Intensive**: Building and maintaining multiple assets require significant investment. This can be seen as a waste of public resources, especially if one of the assets is underutilized.

2. **Environmental Impact**: More infrastruture means more land use and potentially more pollution, both from construction and increased use. This is a critical concern in the context of sustainability and climate change.

3. **Social Equity**: Paid infrastructure (such as toll roads) is often better maintained and less congested but requires payment. This creates a two-tier system where those who can afford it have access to better infrastructure, raising questions of social equity.

4. **Complexity**: Managing multiple, interconnected assets, each with its own set of challenges and requirements, can be administratively and technically complex and costly.

5. **Induced Demand**: Increasing capacity can sometimes lead to increased demand (as in the case or urban roads), negating some of the intended benefits of congestion reduction.

### And so...

Redundancy in infrastructure can be viewed through different lenses, each with its own set of values and priorities. From a systems thinking perspective, redundancy adds resilience and flexibility to the network. It acts as a buffer, allowing the system to absorb shocks and adapt to changing conditions over time. This is particularly relevant in a world facing increasing uncertainty due to factors like climate change and economic volatility.

In the long term, the "extra capacity" in a network may become a strategic asset in itself, but its value will be significantly influenced by how well it is integrated into broader social and economic policies. These should ideally be aligned with sustainability goals and take into account the diverse needs of the population.

Redundancy in infrastructure isn't just about having more; it's about having more options, more resilience, and more opportunities for sustainable development. But these come with their own set of challenges that require thoughtful planning, innovation and governance.

My job as director of advisory services at [TYPSA](https://www.linkedin.com/company/typsa/) \-a firm largely specialised in design and construction management of big projects- often involves competing with accounting and consulting firms such as the "big four" (EY, Deloitte, PwC, KPMG) or the "MBB" (McKinsey, Bain, Boston Consulting Group). At a very basic, almost reptilian-brain level, clients would often label me as an **engineer**, even though I have worked in the role of consultant most my professional life. On the other hand, clients would call people from those other companies **consultants**, a term that carries a plethora of connotations, both positive and negative.

In my industry (infrastructure), this competition between engineering firms and consulting firms tends to happen in a domain of professional services often referred to as "Advisory", which covers a broad range of activities that guide and support the development, implementation, and management of infrastructure projects, including:

-   Project feasibility and planning
-   Funding and financing
-   Public-private partnerships and other alternative delivery models (alternative to traditional public procurement, that is)
-   Infrastructure regulation and policy
-   Procurement and contract management
-   Project implementation and construction management
-   Asset management and operations
-   Sustainability and climate
-   Stakeholder engagement and community impact
-   Technology, digital transformation and innovation

In this article I want to share my thoughts about a growing phenomenon I observe in the Advisory field, that I like to teasingly call "the Consultant's Cold War", in analogy to the geopolitical tensions that happened in the second half of the 20th century between powers that, without never directly fighting each other, clashed on different fronts and formed alliances to gain global influence.

I argue that there are growing market frictions between consulting firms that are "generalists" such as the big four, and those that are "specialists", such as TYPSA, and that these frictions will continue accelerating as technology fuels the transformation of knowledge work and the businesses that are built around it. General consultants keep growing and diversifying as clients' needs evolve, and they are foraging into technical services that once were reserved to engineering firms. The opposite also happens, i.e. engineering firms providing strategic advisory by leveraging technical knowledge and business acumen, but as I argue below, the upper hand is with the large, generalist firms.

I also believe this phenomenon is happening in other territories of the professional services market (IT, government, education, healthcare, etc.) but I will leave the argument to the people who know about those subjects.

My consulting soul requires me to raise a disclaimer at this point: many of the observations and ideas I share here are perceptions and opinions, thus subjective in nature. I may be wrong, but the debate, and the mere fun of it, are worth the exercise.

## Project or client?

In very broad terms, most of the people that work in a company like TYPSA are engineers or architects, and the services we provide are technical (or "vertical") in nature: calculations, sketches, designs, costing, schedules, etc. Our company is **an engineering consulting firm**, typically organised around specific technical disciplines: civil, mechanical, electrical, environmental, chemical, etc., addressing specific sets of problems and solutions related to engineering projects.

Our business operations are often closely tied to project execution: project management, engineering design, quality control, and field supervision. And, most importantly, **the** **structure is often project-centric**. Teams are formed based on the specific engineering expertise required for a project. This leads to a matrix structure where employees might report to both a project manager and a functional manager.

On the other hand, consulting firms like the big four employ people of different educational backgrounds, predominantly trained in business, finance, economics and law, but also engineers. The services they provide (leaving aside auditing, tax and legal advice) **focus on business management processes**, ("horizontal" in nature) such as operations, human resources, finance, marketing, IT, and so on. This is why they are often called "management consultants".

The business operations of a management consulting firm are more diverse across strategy development, business analysis, market research, change management, and organisational restructuring. They often have a more defined hierarchy, with consultants typically working their way up from junior roles (like analysts) to more senior positions (like partners or directors). And, most importantly, **the structure is often client-centric**, and teams are assembled based on the consulting needs of the client. The focus is more on strategic advice than on hands-on project execution.

## The upper hand

There is a widespread (and sour) perception in my guild that management consulting firms are particularly good at drawing very smart and simple slideshows for which they charge clients dearly, using inputs from hard-working engineers who really know about the subject but get paid peanuts for it.

While I recognise that explaining complex problems in the most simple, intuitive way is an form of art worth remunerating, and that business factors are as important as the technical substance, I also believe engineers know a lot of useful things and generate great value for money.

Yet, the reality is much more complicated than that, at a macro level: It's not just about technical expertise; it's about the entire ecosystem of services, relationships, and brand reputation that firms have built over the years.

> One thing is clear to me, however: today, management consulting firms hold a strong competitive advantage in the infrastructure and construction sector against specialised technical consultants, even though the former lack relevant and specific experience and knowledge in the sector compared to the latter. They have the upper hand. They are the Goliaths. Technical consultants are the Davids.

Why is this, really? The question has puzzled me for a long time. By trying to answer it, I want to turn intuition into a structured explanation that hopefully will help me understand the matter better, and see opportunities and risks more clearly, for my own competitive advantage.

## Goliath's perspective

Management consultants offer a wide array of services that go beyond technical consulting. They can handle everything from financial audits to risk management, business planning, legal advice, digital advice and so on. This "**one-stop-shop**" model is attractive to clients who prefer to have multiple aspects of a project managed under one roof. It simplifies communication, coordination, and billing, making the project management process more streamlined.

These firms also have a **global presence** and can leverage international best practices and resources. They can easily scale up for large projects, pulling in experts from various domains and geographies. This is particularly useful in infrastructure projects that often have international stakeholders and require a diverse skill set.

Furthermore, they have **long-standing relationships** with a wide range of stakeholders, from government bodies to financial institutions. These relationships often translate into a level of trust that can be a decisive factor in awarding contracts. Their reputation, built over decades, acts as a form of social proof, assuring clients of their reliability and expertise, even if it's not inherently specialised. This is why they are sometimes called "professional services networks", a concept that goes far beyond consulting.

While they may lack the deep technical expertise of specialised consultants, **management consultants excel in strategic planning and financial structuring**. In my line of work, for instance, understanding the nuances of public-private partnerships, project finance, and governance can be as critical as the engineering aspects. Their expertise in these areas can often complement the technical aspects, providing a more holistic solution.

These firms also **invest heavily in marketing and thought leadership**. They produce research, whitepapers, and case studies that position them as thought leaders in the industry. This not only **attracts clients but also top talent**, creating a virtuous cycle that further enhances their competitive advantage.

Finally, these firms adapt to market needs nimbly. They **quickly incorporate new technologies** and methodologies into their practice, using data analytics, AI, and other advanced tools to provide insights that may not be readily available to smaller, specialised firms.

In summary, while technical consultants may offer deep, focused expertise, generalist consultants bring a combination of scale, adaptability, and a broad range of services that appeals to large clients with complex needs. This is the value proposition that gives them a competitive edge in the infrastructure and construction sector.

## The Client's perspective

The allure of big management consulting firms such as the big four is undeniable. With their global reach, extensive service offerings, and a brand name that commands respect, these firms are often the go-to choice for owners and managers of large-scale infrastructure projects.

However, I ask the following question: Are clients truly getting value for their money when contracting these generalist firms for specialised infrastructure projects, as opposed to employing specialised technical consultants?

One of the most compelling arguments for choosing a big management consulting firm is the **economies of scale** they offer. Their ability to handle multiple aspects of a project, from financial planning to risk assessment, under one roof is undoubtedly convenient. However, this convenience comes at a cost. These firms often have high overheads, including marketing budgets and administrative expenses, which are inevitably passed on to the client. Moreover, the breadth of services may lead to a "jack of all trades, master of none" scenario, where the quality of specialised tasks may suffer.

Clients should take it seriously to gain skills for conducting basic cost-benefit analyses to determine whether economies of scale genuinely offer value. Breaking down the project into its components and comparing the costs and benefits of specialised vs. generalist services can provide valuable insights.

The brand power of big consultants often leads to a form of market inertia where clients gravitate towards what is familiar and seemingly reliable. This inertia can result in a lack of proper market comparison and an **overreliance on reputation rather than specific expertise**.

To counter this, clients should engage in rigorous market research and consider issuing RFPs (Requests for Proposals) with a balanced set of requirements, thresholds and scoring criteria that allow for and encourage technical consultants to participate and compete fairly. This approach not only broadens the pool of potential service providers but also increases the chances of finding a consultant with specialised skills tailored to the project's needs.

The market dominance of big consulting firms can lead to oligopolistic practices, where the lack of competition allows these firms to dictate terms and inflate prices. This is particularly concerning in sectors requiring specialised knowledge, such infrastructure, where these firms may not have the same level of expertise as specialised firms but can edge them out through aggressive marketing and relationship-building.

Regulatory oversight can play a role in ensuring that contract bidding processes are transparent and competitive. Clients can also adopt alternative forms of delivery that share information and experiences more openly, thereby reducing the information asymmetry that often benefits larger firms.

## David's perspective

Specialised technical consultants are often overshadowed by the marketing prowess and brand recognition of larger, generalist firms like the big four. However, specialised firms have their own unique strengths, particularly in offering deep technical expertise and tailored solutions, especially in the complex field of infrastructure systems. There are specific points of leverage that I believe engineering firms can and should target to gain market power. You may have guessed it: few of them are technical.

Specialised firms should **invest in thought leadership** to expose and showcase their expertise, for instance publishing whitepapers, articles, and case studies specifically targeted to non-technical people, shedding light onto the complexities of specific issues within the infrastructure sector.

Forming alliances with other organisations can provide a platform for specialised firms to showcase their expertise. This could be in the form of joint ventures, project collaborations, or even educational partnerships with academic institutions. These alliances can help in sharing risks, costs, and most importantly, in amplifying each other's strengths.

Networking should be strategic and focused on **building relationships** with key decision-makers in the industry, but **from a broader angle**, breaking the self-imposed boundaries of technical knowledge. This involves organising and participating in industry events, webinars, or forums where decision-makers are present, offering technically robust solutions to complex problems, presented from the perspective of the wider stakeholders. The aim is to move beyond transactional interactions and build relationships that position specialised firm as a go-to experts in the field.

Word of mouth and **client testimonials** remain some of the most effective forms of marketing, yet largely underutilised by engineering consulting firms. They should actively seek testimonials from satisfied clients and use these as a centre part of the marketing strategy, as opposed to the near obsession with the megaproject and its technical features. Detailed case studies that outline the challenges, solutions, outcomes and broader impacts of projects also serve as powerful tools for building credibility.

However, rather than trying to be everything to everyone, **I believe engineering consulting firms should focus on their niche expertise**. I also believe digital transformation plays a crucial role in activating this leverage. In the case of TYPSA, for example, the unique combination of i) deep knowledge of engineering and sustainability principles; ii) infrastructure business expertise; and iii) the skills and experience in developing and implementing specialised asset management systems.

This specialisation should be the cornerstone of all marketing and branding efforts, not only in relation with publicity, social media and marketing materials, but in its core commercial and networking strategy. One effective but perhaps counterintuitive way to do this is to promote managed transparency as common practice in the infrastructure sector, and turn it into a unique selling point (I have written about the paradoxical issue of transparency [in a separate article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/paradox-transparency-jose-cordovilla/?trackingId=nrF7LDjQTEq9AienI4crHA%3D%3D)). Sharing methodologies, technologies used, and even challenges faced in previous projects whilst protecting the interests of the parties will ultimately build trust. It will show potential clients that you're not just a service provider but a partner invested in the project's success and, in the case of engineering problems, it will differentiate the firm in a crowded market and make it attractive to clients looking for specialised knowledge, versus generalist firms.

The key is to leverage specialised expertise as a unique selling point, while also adopting modern, effective methods to increase visibility and build trust. This way, engineering firms can and must position themselves as not just an alternative, but as a go-to solution for clients seeking deep, specialised expertise.

**A fascinating time to be both an engineer and a consultant, for sure.**

In [one of the last articles of my blog](https://infraestructurasygobernanza.com/financiar-vs-costear) (Spanish only) I wrote about the important difference between _infrastructure financing_ and _infrastructure funding_. This issue is increasingly relevant, given the poor levels popularity that “pay per use” (like toll) infrastructure enjoys these days.

Let me give you an example to illustrate what I mean: on December 31 2019 [the concession contract of AUMAR -a company of the Abertis group- expired](https://www.euroweeklynews.com/2019/12/21/spains-ap7-7-motorway-to-go-toll-free-in-parts-on-the-1st-of-january-as-spain-sees-in-the-new-year/). Up until then, AUMAR operated and maintained 373km of the AP-7 motorway between Tarragona and Alicante and 94km of the AP-4 between Seville and Cádiz. The socialist government -following the same policy that had been established by the previous popular government of Rajoy- chose to eliminate tolls, meaning that users of these highways will no longer have to pay to use them. The revenues of the concessionary company were approximately EUR 380 million per year, and the operation and maintenance expenses were around EUR 145 million.

Without entering into the debate of what is a reasonable level of profitability for a private company that operates a public infrastructure or service, the political decision to lift toll barriers has an inescapable consequence: As of January 1 2020, Spanish taxpayers will bear the cost of maintaining these 467km of highways through national taxes, whether we use them or not. Think about it: overnight, the state budget will have an additional expense item of one hundred and forty million euros whilst giving up the toll revenues that would be collected if users continued paying for the use of the roads.

Whether we engineers like it or not, **the decision on who should fund infrastructure costs is -and must be- fundamentally political**, not technical, because infrastructure is a collective good that supports the economic and social well-being of a territory, a matter that goes well beyond the technical parameters or financial balances of a highway. Having said that, the decision should be based on rigorous, duly informed and consulted analysis.

And then I wonder: What information do we taxpayers have to judge whether the government's decision (current and previous) to waive tolls is appropriate or not, other than some news in the press with vague figures about estimated maintenance costs or the [labor dispute](https://www.expansion.com/empresas/transporte/2019/12/05/5de902c9468aebcc018b45e1.html) arising from the carryover of previous AUMAR employees?

How much is estimated that traffic will increase as these roads become free, especially in heavy vehicles, which have the greatest impact on the deterioration of the infrastructure? Precisely how much will it cost to keep those highways as traffic fluctuates, and why has the government given up the option of charging users, at least partially with cheaper toll rates? Where can we find official information from the responsible Ministry about the data, studies and conclusions that led to this decision, so relevant to our taxes?

Unfortunately, this information is not available on [the Ministry's website](https://www.fomento.gob.es/), or on the unbearable [national official gazette (BOE)](https://www.boe.es/index.php?lang=en), or on the [transparency portal of the State](https://transparencia.gob.es/transparencia/en/transparencia_Home/index.html), or anywhere else of easy access to Spanish taxpayers, who are going to bear the cost of that decision. I invite you to check this sad reality for yourself. In some cases, [such as the radiales toll roads](https://elpais.com/elpais/2016/12/12/inenglish/1481549182_337869.html), the Ministry [even refuses to share the studies](https://www.lainformacion.com/empresas/abalos-se-niega-publicar-datos-typsa-avalaron-rebaja-peajes/6510199/) that justify decisions of great relevance, without any national security reasons preventing it.

[![No alt text provided for this image](https://www.linkedin.com//:0)](http://transparencia.gob.es/transparencia/en/transparencia_Home/index.html)

_Picture above: Ministry or Public Works' Transparency Portal. Do not bother, the information that is so relevant to your taxes is not there._

The key to good infrastructure policy is transparency, because transparency is the foundation of good governance. Transparency allows for proper assessment of needs and a clear definition of objectives. It allows you to make well-informed decisions about the optimal way to finance, pay for and operate infrastructure that is strategic for us and also for generations to come. Being more transparent in the analysis forces us to focus more on the real problem, and less on ourselves.

Transparency helps measure results, give feedback, compare planned and actual outcomes, assess the impact of public policies, and make the necessary adjustments so we can move in the right direction. It also unlocks enormous potential for collaboration and innovation, bringing viability to better ways of doing things.

For the private sector - investors, funders, supply chain companies, etc. - it means greater confidence in the baseline conditions, better planning, access to more sources of financing channels that otherwise would be unaffordable due to lack of information, greater competitiveness and wider availability of cost-efficient resources.

Last but not least, transparency allows all stakeholders to have an opinion and participate, or at least feel informed and respected, which reinforces the legitimacy of the territorial and public administration model.

**But, it turns out, there is a problem with transparency: what I come to call "the paradox of transparency."** In our mind, consciously and subconsciously, the issue of transparency produces an ambiguous reaction of attraction and aversion in us. A kind of suspicion that cries: “Yes, yes, transparency is very good, it is a very noble ideal, but… should others know this information that I consider so valuable? Am I not risking something in revealing this information? Will someone use this knowledge to take advantage of me, or even harm me? Does revealing information make me more vulnerable?”

There is no easy answer to these questions. Because **transparency is not a universal truth or a physical law, it is a way of doing things in a certain context, towards a certain end.** Transparency is not a simple solution to a problem. It is a transforming force. There is no one-size-fits-all transparency: there are transparency mechanisms that help us achieve specific objectives. And yes, good planning requires strategically planned transparency.

Of course, if your goal is not aligned with the common good, or if you are in the business of opportunism, short-termism or illicit gain, then transparency is not for you. Public infrastructure policy and management are clearly outside any of these categories.

My personal tendency is to share information, because I strongly believe that if some information is useful to me, sharing it will benefit me and others in the long run. This does not mean that I wish to become a totally transparent being: I appreciate and respect my privacy and the confidentiality commitments I have with my loved ones - including those with my clients.

But I do have a clear criterion for sharing information: if I share it, I will increase the possibility of generating ideas and learn. The uncertainty about where that information will end up forces me to reflect and strive to understand problems better, which makes me less fragile (paradoxically). It does not make my life easier, but it makes it richer and more sustainable. For me, sharing information is one of the ingredients of my resilience as a person.

_Picture above: Does transparency make me weaker? It depends on how I use it, and for what purpose._

Beyond my personal convictions and philosophy, there are powerful examples of how well-managed transparency makes companies, institutions and communities more capable and robust.

An example that I mentioned in [my monographic series on PPPs](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ppp-crisis-part-six-long-term-value-creation-jose-cordovilla/) is that of Transport for London (TfL), which in 2016 decided to publish, in real time, all the data about the service it manages, whilst guaranteeing the anonymity and security of the users. This initiative has triggered a multitude of software applications developed by private companies, NGOs and individuals who offer services -for profit, leisure or social purposes- that bring value to users and society as a whole. I insist: transparency, even when well planned, does not make life easier for those who exercise it. As a matter of fact, that should not be the goal of transparency. It does, however, facilitate dynamism, continuing improvement and adaptability.

Open source software, which anyone can use, modify or share -under the particular conditions established in the licenses- found great skepticism and resistance at firs, mainly because it was thought to be more vulnerable and less profitable than proprietary software. Paradoxically, the opposite is true: Precisely because it is open to scrutiny and experimentation, any flaws are detected and corrected quickly, and the software is more reliable, more flexible to change and more secure. It may well be that [the key to the cybersecurity problem is in open source computing](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2019/10/03/the-rise-of-open-source-computing).

In Spain we have many government bodies committed to open data publishing, although the lack of standards prevents most of these data from actually being used by the public. There are also institutions such as AIReF that devote great efforts to publish data about [public management -mainly economic-](https://www.airef.es/es/datalab/ccll-lab/) in Spain, although it still represents a tiny fraction of the data that technically could -and should- be accessible to anyone.

If we travel further back to the basics of infrastructure data, we find that in Spain -as it happens in many other countries- we do not know precisely what infrastructure we have. We do have coarse estimates, such as the [IMF's public investment database](https://www.imf.org/external/np/fad/publicinvestment/) or the high-level studies carried out by [IVIE in partnership with the BBVA Foundation](https://www.ivie.es/es_ES/bases-de-datos/capitalizacion-y-crecimiento/series-historicas-de-capital-publico/) since 1995, but we do not have an up-to-date, homogeneous inventory of our country's infrastructure, its condition or their level of service, i.e. to what extent they fulfill their function of bringing a positive impact to our lives. In these circumstances, can we expect our infrastructure to be financed and managed properly? I think not.

Furthermore, and contrary to what we might conventionally think, [a public-private roundtable organized by my firm Solvere to discuss data, climate change and sustainable financing](https://www.solvere.es/blog/madrid-roundtable.html) on the occasion of COP25 revealed that it is the private sector that holds the largest amount of undisclosed data, which could unlock great economic and social impact if they were shared. The current business culture is to regard the data we hold as valuable _per se_, when the reality is that value only realises when the data is used, i.e. exchanged in some form. The inhibitor of the potential of private sector data is the lack of standards to properly define what are private, open or shared data, and what pre-emptive licenses and business models can be assigned for their use and distribution, so that we do not have to negotiate case-by-case.

A good illustration of the power of open standards is in [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/?lang=en), which offers a set of preemptive licenses that authors can choose from to safeguard the use and distribution of their intellectual creations. In the specific case of climate risk and sustainable infrastructure financing, [the IcebreakerOne initiative](https://icebreakerone.org/) is developing an open standard to enable the exchange of relevant data for analysis and decision-making, leveraging on the successful experience of the [Open Banking Standard](https://standards.openbanking.org.uk/).

The fear of losing competitive advantage when information is shared is actually justified. Currently, we private businesses do not have sufficient guarantees to share our valuable data safely and profitably. In the absence of proven business models, sharing data is perceived as a leap of faith, with notable legal and commercial risks. The key is [develop a culture where data is treated as infrastructure itself](https://theodi.org/topic/data-infrastructure/), building the resources and standards that support an ecosystem where potential gains exceed potential losses.

![No alt text provided for this image](https://www.linkedin.com//:0)

_Picture above: Smart cities? No thanks. I'd rather have open and transparently managed cities._

As mobility and communication increase and more data are generated, the complexity and difficulty of being up to speed -understanding what is happening and how reality is changing- are increasing. This is especially true for infrastructure systems, which are very complex. The risks associated with sharing data are nothing compared to the risks associated with not sharing them. The main risk faced by companies and institutions in the infrastructure sector is uncontrolled disruption. That is why it is essential to develop the mechanisms and rules that make important infrastructure information accessible, usable and exchangeable.

At a time when we constantly fantasize about smart cities, which [in actual fact are far from being technically viable](https://theodi.org/article/smart-cities-are-decades-away-but-open-cities-are-in-reach?mc_cid=8549ace31a&mc_eid=54ed53a858), **we should rather be concerned about making our cities and our communities more open, and managed with transparency**. In doing so, we will gain a clearer understanding of the different dimensions of the sustainability challenge, allowing us to focus on the real underlying problems, which are social and environmental, not technological. Ultimately, not only we will be able to align technology with our key goals, but also reinforce the governance instruments that help us accomplish them.

Let's be brave, overcome the paradox of transparency and focus on the real problems. Our sustainability is at stake.

### INTRODUCTION TO AN INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT MODEL THAT FAILS TO MEET EXPECTATIONS

The provision of infrastructure is a first-order task for any public body responsible for the development and welfare of a territory. There is no doubt about the value or importance of infrastructure as a backbone of the lives of people, communities, businesses, institutions and the environment.

A very different matter is how to plan, execute and manage infrastructure. Public policies in this area are subject to a multitude of conditions - budgetary, technical, social, legal, procedural, among others - and affect and are also influenced by a large number of stakeholders. The people who design a specific infrastructure policy have a very complex problem before them, not least because they know their decisions will determine -often irreversibly- the development patterns of their territory for several generations.

In this context, one of the issues that generates more expectations, debate and controversy is public-private partnerships, which we generally call PPPs. It is an attractive delivery model for the public sector because it is expected to bring additional resources, efficiency and long-term value creation into the arduous task of satisfying the growing demand for public infrastructure and services. In practice, however, the expected benefits often do not materialize and the management of model is complex, misunderstood and sometimes badly planned, hardly managed or even failed, as evidenced by the data on infrastructure PPPs in recent years, as we will see.

The speed and complexity of the social change that we are experiencing and the increasing indebtedness of governments push them towards “simplistic” models of development and management like the conventional PPP model which, despite its formal sophistication, is rigid in essence. The political decision stems from the belief that there is a direct and automatic connection between causes -setting up the legal framework, obtaining financing, signing contracts, provision of human and material resources- and effects -conclusion of the works, effective provision of the service, economic growth, etc.

As it turns out, in an increasingly complex and unpredictable environment, governments enter long-term collaboration agreements (contracts) for expensive, immovable assets that must function and generate value for decades. **It is an unsustainable approach, clearly heading for failure**. The political decisions to use PPPs are not taking into account dynamics and motivations that actually determine the outcomes, and in the best of cases does not count in the flexibility to deal with the changes that will undoubtedly ensue. The vulnerability of the traditional PPP model is evident in the failure to spread its use, despite the remarkable efforts of governments and multilateral institutions to do so. In the second chapter of this series we will examine these in detail.

> The polarization in world politics is no stranger to the world of PPPs. The prevailing ideological positions are increasingly extreme when it comes to private sector participation, without necessarily having an open, rigorous, genuine and rational debate on the problem.

If the objective of a PPP is to generate fruitful and lasting partnerships between diverse actors, it must evolve from the existing paradigm, in which the protagonist is the work or the asset, the legal architecture and its outputs (fundamentally investments), towards a systemic approach that matches the complex and interconnected reality. Such an approach considers infrastructure as a system of systems, similar to living organisms with different dimensions and behaviors: assets, people, organizations and the information that flows between them. Furthermore, these ecosystems do not live in a vacuum, but in specific territories of unique characteristics.

The new PPP paradigm can -and should- host adaptive models of collaboration, similar to those we already see in sectors such as information technology, where many entities truly collaborate, compete and adapt to survive. The success of this type of collaboration will not be based on the ultimate goal of growth per se, but on intelligent adaptation, taking advantage of each relationship for the benefit of the whole.

My purpose in this series of seven articles is to:

-   Review the history and fundamentals of PPPs;
-   Analyze the main arguments that justify the adoption of traditional PPP models: financing, efficiency and long-term value;
-   Review how these arguments actually perform, looking at the dynamics that determine the outcome of PPPs in real life; and
-   Share some ideas and reflections about principles of good governance in public-private infrastructure collaboration.

### ASCENT AND DEBACLE OF A PUBLIC PROCUREMENT MODEL

Private participation in (or the privatization of) infrastructure is usually addressed from the public perspective, based on the fact that we dealing with public goods, which therefore deserve a differentiated treatment. Consequently, the natural state of infrastructure is public and private participation is a break off from this natural state towards a situation that must be regulated. This vision is logical in the welfare state and constitutional law that accompany modern economic development, which recognizes access to many of the services related to infrastructure as a basic right.

However, to better understand the fundamentals behind the current debates and controversies about PPPs, it is worth taking perspective and observing that private participation in infrastructure provision has historically been a markedly cyclical process. This leads us to differentiating the ownership of the service from its provision, its financing and its final delivery.

As a matter of fact, private participation in infrastructure provision has frequently preceded the public sector. From the mid-nineteenth century to the Second World War, many of the great new transport infrastructure (mainly railways) and electricity generation and transport in Europe and the United States were financed, built, operated and owned by private companies. As the service became universal, the monopolistic nature of infrastructure assets and the potential downsides to the users gradually revealed: monopolies can -and often do- abuse their market power. This was one of the determining factors - although not the only one - that led to the global wave of nationalizations after the Second World War and until the 1970s.

The demands and expectations of citizens regarding how much infrastructure and services the public sector must provide have grown steadily ever since, much faster than the public resources needed to satisfy them. Between the 1970s and 1990s, this growing deficit led many governments in Europe and Latin America to the privatisation of water and energy distribution companies under the supervision of a regulator. Other governments decided to contract out the construction and operation of transport infrastructure (French, Spanish or Chilean concession model), and the United Kingdom adopted an innovative model for the provision of so-called 'social infrastructures', such as education and health: the Private Finance Initiative (PFI).

The PFI can somehow be considered the precursor of PPPs as we know them. This model gradually strengthened the application of financing with limited resources to the project (Project Finance) to public infrastructure -until then, it had been limited to private investments in the oil industry and power generation projects. In the PFI model, the private company finances, builds and maintains the infrastructure and equipment that support the provision of the service, while the government continues to provide the direct service to the user with public resources (doctors, nurses, teachers, etc.).

The global financial and fiscal crisis that began in 1997 in Asia and later extended to Russia, Argentina and Brazil was an inflection point for PPPs, because many of the investment projects developed in these regions used PPPs with US dollar-denominated lending that lacked the risk coverage and guarantee instruments that are considered fundamental today.

> Between 1997 and 1999, private investment in infrastructure fell almost 40%. In fact, the investment level of 1997 would not be reached again until eleven years later.

In the first decade of the 21st century, processes of economic reform took place in emerging economies whose external debt went into default; these processes were supported by multilateral financial institutions such as the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Monetary Fund. This period saw the growth and maturing of complex financial instruments such as sovereign guarantees, partial credit guarantees, export credits, project co-financing and public infrastructure PPPs.

Concessional loans or grants to emerging countries have come along the promotion of PPPs, including legal and institutional reforms that facilitate the implementation of this procurement model. The multilateral banks and other institutions such as the OECD are, in fact, the institutions that have most actively promoted the current PPP model. The confluence of an economic boom and the promotion of PPPs between 2002 and 2012 helped private investment in infrastructure grow by ten times, as shown in the graphs below, with a particular marked growth in Latin America and South Asia.

_Figure above: Evolution of infrastructure PPPs by region. Source: Own elaboration with_ [_data from the World Bank_](https://ppi.worldbank.org/en/ppi)

It is surprising, then, to observe a drastic change in trend -both in number of new projects and in total investment- of PPPs since 2012, despite the economic recovery in Europe and the United States. One could argue that certain effects of the global financial crisis may have hindered the growth of PPPs, for instance:

-   The aversion to the risk that payment for infrastructure use is insufficient. This is the so-called "demand risk", which arises when the number of users is lower than anticipated or when the fees paid are not enough to offset the costs;
-   More stringent regulatory requirements on commercial and investment banking: Basel processes, which impose significant limitations on the operations that banks can lend to;
-   The growing indebtedness and fiscal deficit of developed countries.

However, these processes alone do not explain the investment debacle in PPPs that we are witnessing.

> Global GDP has increased by approximately 30% since 2012 and government investment in infrastructure has remained at around 2% of GDP per annum, while the proportion of it that goes to PPP investment **has plummeted from 8% to less than 1%**.

![Investment in total infrastructure and proportion that goes into PPPs](https://www.linkedin.com//:0)

_Figure above: Investment in total infrastructure and proportion of PPPs. Own elaboration with data from the_ [_World Bank_](https://ppi.worldbank.org/)_,_ [_IMF_](https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/) _and_ [_Global Infrastructure Hub_](https://outlook.gihub.org/)

In the meantime, the capacity and technical resources available to governments and the private sector to articulate PPPs has increased considerably. Between 2002 and 2017, [the number of countries that had enacted specific laws for PPPs went from 16 to 144](https://ppp.worldbank.org/public-private-partnership/), which shows the remarkable interest that this form of public procurement has attracted, as well as the level of effort from the multilateral institutions that promote it. In many countries, the enactment of laws for PPP has been accompanied by the creation of the so-called 'PPP units', interministerial public agencies responsible for coordinating the institutional framework for planning and developing PPP projects. Multilateral institutions have also established strong [training and accreditation programs for PPP practicioners](https://ppp-certification.com/).

Although commercial banks have reduced their participation in PPP financing since 2008, private capital for infrastructure investment has increased threefold, mainly through the so-called “institutional investors” that include pension funds, sovereign funds, endowments, private investment funds and insurance firms. In 2018, no less than 85 billion dollars [were raised by specific private investment funds for infrastructure](https://www.ft.com/content/933a657f-6421-30a5-bbd2-14c107a44700), an amount equivalent to all the public and private joint investment in PPPs during 2017. It should be clarified that these sources of capital normally shy away from new construction projects, looking for already built infrastructure that has a proven track record of demand and performance.

![Capital raised for private infrastructure funds vs. actual investment in PPPs.](https://www.linkedin.com//:0)

_Figure above: Capital raised for private infrastructure funds vs. actual investment in PPPs. Source: Own elaboration with data from the_ [_World Bank_](https://ppi.worldbank.org/)_,_ [_IMF_](https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/) _and_ [_Global Infrastructure Hub_](https://outlook.gihub.org/)

We must consider the possibility that globalisation and technology have brought an explosion of maturity and knowledge about the actual performance of PPPs, driving both the public and private sector to more conservative positions.

On the other hand, the Global Infrastructure Hub -the G20 initiative that aims to increase the quality and availability of information about infrastructure worldwide- estimates that the investment to develop and maintain the infrastructure that is needed to achieve the sustainable development goals [is approximately 15 trillion (millions of millions) of US dollars above current levels](https://www.gihub.org/), i.e. on top of what is currently being invested.

I then ask the following question: Given the needs; the availability of more and better information; greater knowledge; more institutional capacity -including regulatory and operational frameworks; greater public investment in infrastructure; and wider availability of capital and interest from the private sector, why is PPP investment decreasing in relative terms? Furthermore, how can we reverse this paradoxical disagreement between the public and private sectors and realise the public-private collaboration that is so much talked about?

In the next chapter of this monographic series, I will examine the current PPP model in search of answers.

### A review of conventional PPPs and the 3 main reasons to choose them.

As I described in Part Two, the conventional PPP model is the result of an evolution of infrastructure and development policies in a number of countries; policies that multilateral institutions have promoted, adapted and gathered in a sort of “body of knowledge” that has reached theoretical and practical maturity, as reflected in the [PPP Knowledge Lab](https://pppknowledgelab.org/) initiative.

The benefits touted by the defenders of the traditional PPP model are many, but three of them stand out in particular, namely:

1.  Access to more financing for infrastructure provision;
2.  Creation of short and medium-term public value through an optimal allocation of risks between the parties;
3.  Creation of long-term public value through the consolidation of dynamics of collaboration with the private sector that increase the capacity of public sector managers, the exchange of knowledge, the economic activity and ultimately the social welfare of the beneficiaries.

![The three pillars of the PPP model](https://www.linkedin.com//:0)

_Figure above: The three pillars of the PPP model_

There is no single definition of a PPP: it is very difficult to have it, given the breadth and variety of the issues it covers. Nonetheless, there are a number of features that identify a conventional PPP more or less clearly, to name a few:

-   They are based on one of more contracts between a government (public partner) and the private sector (private partner) to carry out an infrastructure or service, with the public partner maintaining the ownership of the asset. It is, therefore, a form of public procurement.
-   The ultimate purpose of the contract is not the provision of the physical infrastructure -the asset- itself, but the service it brings to the users.
-   The investment amounts required for the construction and operation of the infrastructure are very large (often in the hundreds of millions of Euros).
-   The contracts are articulated so that each risk is allocated to the party most capable of managing it -this is the principle of efficient risk allocation. In practice, it follows from this principle that the private partner brings financial resources that the public partner does not have, in addition to the experience and incentives needed to construct and operate the infrastructure efficiently.
-   The private partner finances, builds and operates the infrastructure in exchange for the right to receive payment from the users, the public partner or both.
-   It is usually delivered through “special-purpose vehicle (SPV) companies” that assume the contractual rights and obligations.
-   A substantial part of the investment is financed by debt -most PPPs are “leveraged” investments. This makes the credit contracts a fundamental and determining element of PPPs.
-   The contract term is usually very long, precisely because of the time needed to repay the creditors in full.
-   At the end of the contract the infrastructure or public good is usually handed back to the public partner, who will decide on the subsequent form of management.

According to the conventional thinking about PPPs, these principles should suffice to, once deployed in an appropriate institutional and economic environment, encourage competitiveness and maximise the benefits private participation in infrastructure provision. It turns out, however, that **the results are often the opposite**.

This is because of the dysfunctionality of the traditional PPP model, which directs all efforts and attention to the technical sophistication of the contractual instruments and financial flows, neglecting phenomena that shape much more subtly and decisively the result of the collaboration. Moreover, the impact of this decoupling between PPPs and reality goes beyond individual projects: it gradually undermines the confidence in the model and, ultimately, in the institutions that legitimise it.

At the center of this dysfunctionality is the complexity of the system where the infrastructures dwell: an increasingly numerous, more interdependent, more dynamic, less linear, less hierarchical, more demanding and more unpredictable system. Citizens demand more and better infrastructure solutions for problems that arise from this very complexity, which in the case of cities is exacerbated. What is more, whether the demands are reasonable or not often becomes an irrelevant question.

_Figure above: Theory and reality of PPPs. Reality holds many interdependencies_

In the next parts of this series I will examine the difference between theory and reality for each of the three pillars of the conventional PPP model: i) access to more financial resources, ii) greater efficiency in the provision of the service; and iii) long-term benefits from collaborating and the exchanging of experience between the parties.

### THE FIRST PILLAR OF PPPs: ACCESS TO MORE FINANCING TO MAKE INFRASTRUCTURE POSSIBLE

The main -and most powerful reason- why governments turn their interest to the PPP model is to attract financial resources from the private sector to finance more infrastructure without increasing public debt.

> Most public infrastructure has very high investment costs and low cost-recovery rates -mainly for political reasons, thus frequently requiring tariff subsidies.

The fiscal constraints and the lack of flexible, innovative and socially responsible financial instruments push many governments to the use of highly indebted PPPs through commercial loans, for the financing of infrastructure that is not economically self-sustainable in the short -term. It is not difficult to conclude that this is just a mirage -the mirage of PPPs- once we remember that, in practice, only a minimum part of public infrastructure is financed by this procurement model (see charts in [Part Two](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ppp-crisis-part-two-history-jose-cordovilla/)).

The mirage of PPPs **becomes more vivid to the eyes of regional and local governments**, who are eager to replicate development phenomena that they see happening in large cities and therefore quickly seduced by the appeal of large private investments.

These governments hardly recognise that it is precisely the intrinsic dynamics of large cities that generate the continuous flow of capital that sustain private investment, not the PPP formula itself. Here lies precisely a great risk of resounding PPP failures, which fuel public opposition to this type of collaboration.

Because what happens in reality is: In the absence of steady and proven revenue streams, the private sector will not jump to the arena unless there are mechanisms in place to supplement or replace user payments (investment aid, co-financing, availability payment) or hedging instruments (public guarantees and insurance). Many of these measures, as [Eurostat](https://www.eib.org/attachments/thematic/epec_eurostat_statistical_guide_en.pdf) and the [European Court of Auditors](https://www.eca.europa.eu/es/Pages/DocItem.aspx?did=45153) have concluded, often distort the principle of risk transfer by which the higher cost of (private) debt will be offset by efficiency gains in the provision. The 2017 Spanish law for public procurement already contains detailed provisions (Art.14) about the transfer of operational risk, something that did not exist in the previous version of the law and has been incorporated by mandate of the [European Concession Directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/ES/ALL/?uri=OJ%3AJOL_2014_094_R_0001_01).

An example of questionable diligence in the public management of operational risk can be found in ACESA, the first of Spain's highway concessions, which was granted in 1967 and after fifty-two years endures thanks to successive modifications and extensions of the contract poorly managed by the government counterpart: the last addendum of 2006 resulted in a lawsuit from the concessionaire, who claims up to EUR 3,000 million in compensation.

On the other hand, the most expensive elements of infrastructure projects often have very long lifespans, some reaching over 50 years (for instance, large structures or road embankments). The accounting of these assets is done in practice using accelerated depreciation rates, resulting in much shorter depreciation periods than the actual physical deterioration, and allowing for a reduction of the corporate tax base. We should remember that the vehicle companies are often articulated through complex corporate arrangements and capital flows through subsidiaries in tax havens. These large financial operations are therefore susceptible to contributing to tax base erosion and profit shifting, a process that significantly weakens the ability to achieve a fundamental objective of PPPs: the creation of public value.

![Factors that erode the PPP principle of additional financial resources](https://www.linkedin.com//:0)

_Figure above: Factors that erode the PPP principle of additional financial resources_

A notable case of this phenomenon is Thames Water, the private company that manages water supply and sewerage in London. This company has been involved in huge controversies for having distributed [large dividends to its successive shareholders while the quality of service decreased](https://www.ft.com/content/5413ebf8-24f1-11e7-8691-d5f7e0cd0a16) and [debt increased dramatically](https://www.ft.com/content/61bd8f0a-9181-11e7-bdfa-eda243196c2c), despite the sophisticated control mechanisms put in place by the public regulator. The United Kingdom privatised the companies providing water supply and sewerage services in the 1980s, along with the creation of an independent regulator, OFWAT, who sets the targets for service performance, the tariff rate structures, investment requirements and profitability caps for these operators.

This case is not alone in the long history of private participation in water in the UK: a [comprehensive study by the University of Greenwich](https://gala.gre.ac.uk/id/eprint/21097/) concluded in 2018 that increases in household water bills (40% since the privatisation in 1989) have ended up covering the growing interests of the debt, despite the fact that tariff increases were designed to offset cost escalation and to cover investments for the extension and improvement of the infrastructure.

The argument of PPPs bringing additional financial resources therefore requires a detailed examination of the legal and financial fundamentals of infrastructure, and especially of how they address the service requirements and the dynamics of interests, capacities and limitations of the parties involved, along with the governance mechanisms that help consolidate long-term objectives. Let us not forget that large public interest projects such as PPPs transcend financial issues, and yet finance currently attracts most the attention. The question of financing for investment should be one of the many elements in the set of factors behind strategic decision making for the territory.

### THE SECOND PILLAR OF PPPs: EFFICIENCY GAINS

The second pillar of PPPs is the introduction of greater efficiency and reliability in the construction and operation of the service by the private partner. Efficiency gains, however, do not arise from the private sector itself, but from the mechanisms that enable the alignment of interests and capacities of the parties.

In the United Kingdom, where the PPP model was first implemented, [the National Audit Office carried out in 2018 a comprehensive evaluation of the Private Finance Initative (PFI)](https://www.nao.org.uk/report/pfi-and-pf2/), which the government used to develop hundreds of social infrastructure projects over three decades with a total accumulated investment of 60 billion pounds and payments to the private sector close to 10 billion pounds per annum. The report concludes that this form of procurement has turned out to be forty to sixty per cent more expensive than the public alternative.

Among the root causes of the cost overruns detailed in the report are: poor efficiency in construction and operation by the private partner; numerous changes to the initial contract conditions (opportunistic modifications); and systematic inflation of costs.

The construction sector is up to [fifty per cent less productive than other industrial sectors](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2017/08/17/the-construction-industrys-productivity-problem), and in nominal terms is less productive than 50 years ago. [Recent studies](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/capital-projects-and-infrastructure/our-insights/improving-construction-productivity) also reveal that the vast majority of large infrastructure projects systematically overrun the budgets and schedules established originally. It follows that, as long as the serious problem of low sector productivity is not addressed, PPPs will continue to be risky business for the taxpayer.

The diversion of benefits away from the PPP company (the special purpose vehicle or SPV, as we call the company that assumes all the rigts and obligations of the private partner) through uncompetitive sub-contracts with companies affiliated to the SPV owners is another practice in the sector that erodes efficiency gains. The subcontracting mechanisms are often opaque to the public and not subject to competition. As a result, the SPV's financial position can be compromised, turning into losses or diminished reserve budgets for infrastructure renewal or contingencies, thus affecting the condition of the assets, the quality of the service and, ultimately, the user demand levels. These transfer pricing practices fuel a vicious circle that may end in the bankruptcy of the SPV, bailing out by the government, possible disruption of the service and public mistrust in this type of collaboration.

> Efficiency gains from PPPs are achievable, theoretically, but the evidence shows we are still lacking effective mechanisms to govern the dynamics or reality and ensure that this efficiency materializes.

The transaction costs -the costs incurred in the planning, procurement and financing- of these projects are high, so the private sector will favor larger investments to benefit from economies of scale and to satisfy the interests of advisors and agents. According to my experience in structuring infrastructure PPPs, the average cost of preparing and contracting a PPP for the public sector ranges between two and three per cent of the total investment cost.

To overcome this problem, governments often resort to the aggregation of projects in large packages (we call this “bundling”) to make the contracts more appealing to the market. The problem with this approach is: the social and economic value of an infrastructure project comes from the quantity and quality of the public service it provides, not from its size.

![No alt text provided for this image](https://www.linkedin.com//:0)

_Figure above: Factors that erode the principle of efficiency gains from private participation_

Coming back to an example we used in [Part Four](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ppp-crisis-part-four-financing-jose-cordovilla/), embankments are a relatively expensive component of a road project, but they are usually simple to construct and do not require the arrangement of complicated private finance contracts: there is probably more value to the public in using a standard procurement process. On the other hand, the combination of technical and financial innovation from the private sector can bring significant efficiency gains to user comfort, demand management and traffic safety. The bundling of high and low efficiency project components in a single, privately-financed contractual structure is another of the vicious circles that perpetuate the dysfunctionality of the PPP model. The scale criterion does not guarantee efficiency gains by itself; as a matter of fact, efficiency may end up being compromised when mixing just for the sake of size.

If the intention is to build long-term collaborations, it makes more sense to disaggregate the infrastructure asset into smaller components according to their characteristics and functions, and then allocate public and/or private involvement in these components only to the extent that positive collaboration dynamics can be created and sustained, avoiding technical, financial or institutional arragements that may, in time, compromise the quality and continuity of the service. The problem of disaggregation is the introduction of the so-called "interface risk", which relates to conflicts between the parties responsible for managing each side. This is where technological innovations -such as the use of smart contracts- combined with basic transparency principles can reinforce, not erode, the interfaces, thus mitigating the risk of conflict.

Regarding public procurement of PPPs, the efficiency principle clashes directly with the complexity and duration of the administrative and legal processes, which create a _de facto_ barrier to competition with long-term effects of market concentration due to economies of scale and shortage of professional skills, resulting in small numbers of competing bids for contracts that carry enormous economic and social relevance.

> The efficiency in public procurement has a direct relationship with the eventual efficiency gains in the provision of the service, therefore in the creation of public value.

The conclusion is that the efficiency in PPPs is not self-assured and requires strong governance mechanisms to create collaboration and trust dynamics that deliver sustained positive results. These mechanisms include i) rigorous and independent diagnosis of each party's capacities, interests and limitations; ii) transparency and strategic data management; iii) the use of technology with principles to address conflict areas.

### THE THIRD PILLAR OF PPPs: COLLABORATION, KNOWLEDGE SHARING AND LONG-TERM BENEFITS.

The financial and technical arguments for PPPs, described in [Part Four: Financing](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ppp-crisis-part-four-financing-jose-cordovilla/) and [Part Five: Efficency](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ppp-crisis-part-five-efficiency-jose-cordovilla/) of this monographic series, respectively, are the most explicit and powerful in the discourse about the advantages of the model. There is, however, a third argument that often stays in a secondary position in the debate, but nonetheless has a much greater influence in the long-term outcome: the ability of the PPP to generate sustained benefits for all stakeholders. We refer to benefits beyond the financial return for the private partner, the fulfilling of the technical requirements of the public partner or the satisfaction of the user receiving the service.

> The value proposition of a PPP usually includes broader aspirations, such as improving the economy and the quality of life in the area, fostering the competitiveness of the private sector, strengthening the institutional capacity of the public sector, generating and exchanging knowledge and professional skills, and so on.

These broad and substantive results (called “outcomes”, as opposed to the short-term "outputs" such as the provision of the service) only become visible in the long run, and they are built gradually, through complex aggregation and positive reinforcement processes taking place between the components of the infrastructure-environment system. Processes fueled by the availability and use of information, the perceptions and actions of the PPP partners, the trust in the rules and mechanisms of collaboration, the knowledge and skills of decision makers and managers, the satisfaction of the user and the taxpayer, etc.

It is precisely these qualitative, intangible elements that confer the jointly-created PPP the ability to adapt and grow. The opposite is also true: their absence generates dynamics of distrust, opportunism, short-termism, erosion of legitimacy and ultimately the termination of the contract and the end of the collaboration.

The strength of a PPP contract lies in the ability of the parties to sustain the values, capabilities, commitments and joint efforts that have motivated it. This is where governance plays a fundamental role in the viability and sustainability of PPPs.

Governance is the bridge that connects values, intentions, efforts and decisions of all parties with the outputs and outcomes of the venture. The longer the duration of the collaboration, the stronger the governance framework should be. The dysfunctionality of the traditional PPP model is due, above all, to the excessive attention we draw to the sophistication of contracts and procedures, at the expense of overlooking the dynamics that forge trust and collaboration among the stakeholders.

The public partner will tend to focus on justifying the viability of the investment, preparing the optimal procurement mechanism and attracting as much private sector competition as possible. In practice, however, **the sustainability of a PPP ultimately depends on the skills and experience of the public servants** who must understand and manage the complexities and unforeseen events over time. These people make decisions in highly uncertain environments that will actually have consequences on the development patterns of several generations to come. In their hands is the creation of intergenerational value.

In Ireland, for example, after the outbreak of the financial crisis of 2008 and the collapse of the construction industry, there was a massive exodus of professionals from the sector that years later led to a critical deficit of workforce to implement a new infrastructure PPP program. The government faced a shortage of professional skills with the corresponding cost inflation for human resources. In Eastern European countries, attempts have been made to develop large PPP programs in infrastructure in the last ten years, but most governments have been failed to manage the programs, finally resorting to conventional public procurement formulas.

PPPs are complex ventures that require a high degree of training and specialisation by all partners involved. The retention of talent capable of managing these ventures is an essential ingredient for long-term success. Instead of focusing solely on building the enormous formal structures required in a PPP, the public partner should first design and implement a strategic program for human and material resources to underpin the infrastructure plan and support the recruitment, training and retention of skilled and committed professionals. A capable public sector is a necessary condition for a successful PPP.

_Figure above: Factors that erode the goal of long-term benefit creation_

Other, much more subtle and powerful causes of the scouring of the foundations of a PPP relate to communication and language. **The opaque and technocratic terminology of PPPs is, in itself, an obstacle to collaboration**. PPPs that use clear, simple and direct language to communicate the intentions, objectives, responsibilities and rights of the parties - including users, taxpayers and other interest groups- are few and far between. The technical, financial and legal jargon that accompanies PPPs creates barriers to the understanding and decision-making capacity of many participants in the joint venture. This is the seed of distrust towards PPPs and the potential loss of legitimacy of the institutions that promote it.

> Collaboration in a diverse and complex environment needs common languages.

I do not argue that technical, financial or legal documents do not require specific languages, but that an extraordinarily important requirement is the existence of a common, clear language to provide sense, alignment and trust between all parties, including of course the general public. It is certainly a task that needs vast collective efforts, but equally necessary. Moreover, if the right incentives are in place, it is an attainable goal. We have -again- real examples in the software sector, which thrives on collaborative ecosystems that use “high-level” languages (much simpler and less technical than their predecessors), open source applications and transparent yet robust exchange protocols.

**Transparency is another** _**sine qua non**_ **requirement for successful infrastructure PPPs.** Take [the case of the "radiales" roads in Spain,](https://elpais.com/elpais/2016/12/12/inenglish/1481549182_337869.html) for example. The Spanish public opinion is that these PPP projects "privatize profits and socialize losses", referring to the "rescue" of the concessionary companies by the Ministry of Public Works. At the core of this rescue is the _Responsabilidad Patrimonial de la Administracion_, or RPA, a legal obligation for the government to compensate companies for past investments less amortization following project default and takeover. The companies involved in this case claim that land acquisition costs were much higher and revenues much lower than foreseen. However, there is little talk on the streets about the financing banks, which have lost up to 70% of the loans they made to the companies to build the roads. And much less is known about the successive decisions made by the government from inception of the projects until their default, and the subsequent rescue and possible liabilities.

Now, my point about transparency: To date, there is ZERO public information on the [website of the Ministry](https://www.fomento.gob.es/) if one wishes to understand why it was decided at the time that those projects were needed and feasible, what led to the default, what the consequences were, what are the liabilities (current and future) of each party (including the taxpayer), or what measures are currently in place to protect the public interest, avoid further damage to collaborations with the private sector and incorporate the lessons learned in future ventures.

The lack of clarity and transparency is pure fuel for widespread distrust about infrastructure PPPs in Spain, which have seen some bad times in the history of infrastructure in the country, but have also generated many sucessful stories, although less likely to appear in press headlines.

An example of the benefits of transparency in infrastructure is in Transport for London (TfL), the London municipal company in charge of urban transport, which in 2016 decided to make all the service information available to the public online, in real time, whilst guaranteeing the anonymity and security of the users. This initiative has triggered a multitude of software applications developed by private companies, NGOs and individuals that offer services and solutions -for profit, leisure or social purposes- that are valuable value to users and society in general.

**Tightly coupled with transparency is the issue of conflicts of interest.** In increasingly complex environments the cause-effect relationship tends to blur and it becomes more difficult to identify the flows of interests. In order for collaborations to last, they need to i) be structured in a coherent way for their purpose; and ii) provide mechanisms that allow adaptation to change. Long-term benefits will materialise if both tasks rely on:

-   Transparency about needs, advantages, weaknesses and interests of the parties when defining the collaboration structure, as well as its operation.
-   Capacity and rigour in the collection and treatment of all relevant information for decision-making, communication and dissemination, as a safeguard against opportunistic behaviours that might damage the principles of partnership.
-   Flexibility, which implies boldness to take some risks and enable environments where innovative formulas can be tested, in a way that the downsides -in case of failure- can be reasonably assumed and the upsides -if succesful- are shared.

> [!summary] The Strategic Case for Railway Infrastructure Funding
> Reflecting on my recent presentation at the Rail Live! industry forum in Madrid, I would like to share the key points I spoke about, that I believe are crucial for our industry, especially the strategic case for railway infrastructure projects and the securing of long-term funding sources.

Reflecting on my recent presentation at the [Rail Live!](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rail-live-terrapinn/) industry forum in Madrid, I would like to share the key points I spoke about, that I believe are crucial for our industry, especially the strategic case for railway infrastructure projects and the securing of long-term funding sources.

My bottom line is that, in an increasingly complex world, the case for investing in infrastructure should focus more on the strategic case (why the investment is needed to provide and protect the wellbeing in the long term, i.e. resilience) and less on the conventional views of economic and financial analysis.

Conventional analysis assumes that the underlying assumptions will prevail, or at worst they will remain within the limits of the sensitivity analysis of choice. Experience tells us that this is the least likely scenario. Most likely, the complex dynamics of today's world will result in situations that were not foreseen, so the strongest options are those that make us more resilient.

### Funding ≠ Financing

Understanding the distinction between funding and financing is crucial for any infrastructure project's success. This is especially true in the railway sector, where the scale and complexity of projects demand significant resource allocation.

**Financing** refers to the methods through which we acquire the capital needed to initiate a project. This can be through debt, equity, or a combination of both. Financing is the mechanism that allows us to turn plans into reality. For example, when we consider financing a new railway line, we look at loans, bonds, and private investments as potential sources of capital.

On the other hand, **funding** is a broader concept that encompasses the entire financial lifecycle of a project. This includes not just the initial capital, but also the revenue streams that will cover operational costs, maintenance, and debt repayment over time. Funding must consider the long-term financial viability of a project. It's not just about getting the project off the ground; it's about ensuring its sustainability and profitability over decades. In the context of railways, funding would consider fare revenues, government subsidies, and potential income from freight services and other commercial operations, etc.

In more practical terms, sustained funding is a necessary condition for infrastructure investment, operation & upkeep or, in other words, **no sustained funding means no good infrastructure**.

### The Growing Importance of the Strategic Case

A business case for an infrastructure project will typically look at the strategic, technical, economic, financial and delivery aspects.

> My main point is: what generates and sustains funding is the strategic case, because it focuses on the critical outcomes of infrastructure, and therefore generates the stakeholder support and public trust that underpins sustained funding.

The strategic case for infrastructure investment is increasingly pivotal in an era marked by rapid changes and uncertainties. Traditionally, the focus has been on the economic and financial viability of projects. However, these assessments often rest on assumptions about future conditions, which may not hold true in an evolving global landscape.

The strategic case goes beyond financial and economic considerations to encompass wider societal, environmental, and geopolitical impacts. It's about understanding how a project aligns with broader objectives and priorities.

The strategic case looks at **how the project adapts to change**, stress-testing assumptions against potential changes in the technical, economic, political, and environmental landscape, and values **resilience**: the ability of a project to withstand unforeseen shocks, whether they are economic downturns, natural disasters, or geopolitical tensions.

It also focuses on **public and stakeholder engagement**: A project that aligns with public priorities and values is more likely to garner support, which is essential for securing funding. The strategic case assesses how well the project addresses these public priorities, such as environmental sustainability, reduction of carbon emissions or social equity.

In my role at [TYPSA](https://www.linkedin.com/company/typsa/), I have observed a shift in how we approach project planning and development. Increasingly, our clients and stakeholders are recognizing the importance of the strategic case. They understand that for a project to be successful in the long term, it must be resilient, adaptable, and aligned with broader societal goals. Otherwise, it will be vulnerable to change.

This paradigm shift is not just about securing funding; it's about ensuring that our infrastructure investments deliver lasting benefits and contribute to a sustainable future. Let's look at some of the key strategic factors next.

### Strategic Factors in Transport Infrastructure Investments

Several strategic factors are key in generating and sustaining public trust, and thus should take a central part in the decision-making process:

1.  **Social Cohesion**: Does the project generate regional equity, cultural preservation, and community development? Projects that foster social cohesion tend to gain more public support, which is vital for funding.
2.  **Security and Geopolitical Influence**: Does the investment enhance security and influence for our communities? This includes creating network redundancies, which are increasingly vital in our interconnected, yet vulnerable society.
3.  **Sustainability**: With climate change concerns at the forefront, sustainable projects that address climate mitigation, adaptation, resource preservation and protection of ecosystems are more likely to secure funding.
4.  **Economic Resilience**: Does the project contribute to the reliability of supply chains, innovation, and industry competitiveness? Will it attract capital and private sector participation, crucial elements for long-term funding?
5.  **Long-term Institutional Capacity**: Building and maintaining institutional and operational capacity, along with fostering necessary skills, is essential for long-term project success and funding.

### Examples

In my presentation, I highlighted several projects that exemplify the growing importance of the strategic factors in infrastructure investment, where TYPSA has advised:

-   **Security and Influence**: The Helsingborg-Helsingør Fixed Link (road & rail) project, a possible second crossing of the Øresund, focuses heavily on the strategic case for network redundancy, regional interconnectedness and resilience to geopolitical shocks. TYPSA has advised the key stakeholders in the review of the strategic study.
-   **Cohesion and Economic Resilience**: The [EU-Africa strategic railway corridors](https://international-partnerships.ec.europa.eu/policies/global-gateway/transport/eu-africa-strategic-corridors_en) to be financed by the EU Global Gateway are an excellent example of creating railway infrastructure for regional connectivity and economic resilience. The programme aims at developing reliable connectivity networks and services that create jobs and support value chains that can benefit industries in both Africa and Europe. TYPSA has participated in the feasibility studies of several of these corridors.
-   **Transport Planning and Climate**: We have been advisors in the development of several city-wide or regional [Transport Master Plans in Andalusia](https://www.typsa.com/en/projects/campo-de-gibraltar-metropolitan-transport-plan/), where the Regional Government has steered away from demand and supply drivers, adopting climate change mitigation and adaptation, digitisation and affordability as the main decision factors in the multicriteria analysis.
-   **Sustainable Construction**: The Sydney Metro West project, where TYPSA is a designer, involves the construction of twin tunnels from Sydney Olympic Park to The Bays Precinct station. The solution has been conceived around circularity of materials, increased durability and low maintenance, ultimately leading to long-term sustainability.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the landscape of infrastructure funding is evolving. The traditional focus on economic and financial viability is no longer sufficient. To secure long-term funding, we must pivot towards a more strategic approach that encompasses technical, social, environmental, and economic factors. This is where the true future of railway infrastructure lies.

This experience, shared at the Rail Live forum in Madrid, embodies TYPSA’s commitment to adapting to the changing needs of infrastructure funding and planning. Our goal is not just to build infrastructure but to foster projects that are strategically vital, sustainable, and beneficial for societies and economies globally.
