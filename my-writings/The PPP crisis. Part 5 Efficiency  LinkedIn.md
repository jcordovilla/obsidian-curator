### THE SECOND PILLAR OF PPPs: EFFICIENCY GAINS

The second pillar of PPPs is the introduction of greater efficiency and reliability in the construction and operation of the service by the private partner. Efficiency gains, however, do not arise from the private sector itself, but from the mechanisms that enable the alignment of interests and capacities of the parties.

In the United Kingdom, where the PPP model was first implemented, [the National Audit Office carried out in 2018 a comprehensive evaluation of the Private Finance Initative (PFI)](https://www.nao.org.uk/report/pfi-and-pf2/), which the government used to develop hundreds of social infrastructure projects over three decades with a total accumulated investment of 60 billion pounds and payments to the private sector close to 10 billion pounds per annum. The report concludes that this form of procurement has turned out to be forty to sixty per cent more expensive than the public alternative.

Among the root causes of the cost overruns detailed in the report are: poor efficiency in construction and operation by the private partner; numerous changes to the initial contract conditions (opportunistic modifications); and systematic inflation of costs.

The construction sector is up to [fifty per cent less productive than other industrial sectors](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2017/08/17/the-construction-industrys-productivity-problem), and in nominal terms is less productive than 50 years ago. [Recent studies](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/capital-projects-and-infrastructure/our-insights/improving-construction-productivity) also reveal that the vast majority of large infrastructure projects systematically overrun the budgets and schedules established originally. It follows that, as long as the serious problem of low sector productivity is not addressed, PPPs will continue to be risky business for the taxpayer.

The diversion of benefits away from the PPP company (the special purpose vehicle or SPV, as we call the company that assumes all the rigts and obligations of the private partner) through uncompetitive sub-contracts with companies affiliated to the SPV owners is another practice in the sector that erodes efficiency gains. The subcontracting mechanisms are often opaque to the public and not subject to competition. As a result, the SPV's financial position can be compromised, turning into losses or diminished reserve budgets for infrastructure renewal or contingencies, thus affecting the condition of the assets, the quality of the service and, ultimately, the user demand levels. These transfer pricing practices fuel a vicious circle that may end in the bankruptcy of the SPV, bailing out by the government, possible disruption of the service and public mistrust in this type of collaboration.

> Efficiency gains from PPPs are achievable, theoretically, but the evidence shows we are still lacking effective mechanisms to govern the dynamics or reality and ensure that this efficiency materializes.

The transaction costs -the costs incurred in the planning, procurement and financing- of these projects are high, so the private sector will favor larger investments to benefit from economies of scale and to satisfy the interests of advisors and agents. According to my experience in structuring infrastructure PPPs, the average cost of preparing and contracting a PPP for the public sector ranges between two and three per cent of the total investment cost.

To overcome this problem, governments often resort to the aggregation of projects in large packages (we call this “bundling”) to make the contracts more appealing to the market. The problem with this approach is: the social and economic value of an infrastructure project comes from the quantity and quality of the public service it provides, not from its size.

_Figure above: Factors that erode the principle of efficiency gains from private participation_

Coming back to an example we used in [Part Four](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ppp-crisis-part-four-financing-jose-cordovilla/), embankments are a relatively expensive component of a road project, but they are usually simple to construct and do not require the arrangement of complicated private finance contracts: there is probably more value to the public in using a standard procurement process. On the other hand, the combination of technical and financial innovation from the private sector can bring significant efficiency gains to user comfort, demand management and traffic safety. The bundling of high and low efficiency project components in a single, privately-financed contractual structure is another of the vicious circles that perpetuate the dysfunctionality of the PPP model. The scale criterion does not guarantee efficiency gains by itself; as a matter of fact, efficiency may end up being compromised when mixing just for the sake of size.

If the intention is to build long-term collaborations, it makes more sense to disaggregate the infrastructure asset into smaller components according to their characteristics and functions, and then allocate public and/or private involvement in these components only to the extent that positive collaboration dynamics can be created and sustained, avoiding technical, financial or institutional arragements that may, in time, compromise the quality and continuity of the service. The problem of disaggregation is the introduction of the so-called "interface risk", which relates to conflicts between the parties responsible for managing each side. This is where technological innovations -such as the use of smart contracts- combined with basic transparency principles can reinforce, not erode, the interfaces, thus mitigating the risk of conflict.

Regarding public procurement of PPPs, the efficiency principle clashes directly with the complexity and duration of the administrative and legal processes, which create a _de facto_ barrier to competition with long-term effects of market concentration due to economies of scale and shortage of professional skills, resulting in small numbers of competing bids for contracts that carry enormous economic and social relevance.

> The efficiency in public procurement has a direct relationship with the eventual efficiency gains in the provision of the service, therefore in the creation of public value.

The conclusion is that the efficiency in PPPs is not self-assured and requires strong governance mechanisms to create collaboration and trust dynamics that deliver sustained positive results. These mechanisms include i) rigorous and independent diagnosis of each party's capacities, interests and limitations; ii) transparency and strategic data management; iii) the use of technology with principles to address conflict areas.
