    professional_writing_threshold=0.65,  # Lowered for analytical content
    min_content_length=300,  # Reduced to capture valuable short notes
    target_themes=["infrastructure", "construction", "economics"]
)

# Create curator
curator = ObsidianCurator(config)

# Curate vault
stats = curator.curate_vault(
    input_path=Path("my-writings"),
    output_path=Path("curated-vault")
)

print(f"Curated {stats.curated_notes}/{stats.total_notes} notes")
```
