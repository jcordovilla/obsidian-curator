# Legacy Directory

This directory contains files from the old note classification system that have been superseded by the new architecture.

## Legacy Files

### `filter_notes.py`
**Original classification script** - The basic script that started this project. Superseded by the new `note_curator` package.

### `migrate_from_old.py`
**Migration utility** - Helps migrate from the old system to the new one. Only needed during initial setup.

### `loading_notes.py`
**Note loading utility** - Basic note loading functionality now integrated into the main package.

## Migration Status

These files are kept for reference and migration purposes. The new system provides:

- **Better architecture** with modular design
- **Enhanced classification** with expert pillar analysis
- **Professional CLI interface** with progress tracking
- **Rich configuration** via YAML files
- **Comprehensive reporting** in multiple formats

## When to Use Legacy Files

- **Reference only** - Study the old approach for comparison
- **Migration** - Use `migrate_from_old.py` if transitioning from the old system
- **Historical context** - Understand the evolution of the project

## Recommendation

Use the new system exclusively for all current and future work. The legacy files are maintained for historical purposes only.
